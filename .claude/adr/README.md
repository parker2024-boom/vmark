# Architecture decision records

The decisions that rules, comments and docs in this repository cite by id. They live here, tracked, so a
clone can read what `ADR-013` means instead of taking the id on trust.

`pnpm lint:adr-refs` (`scripts/check-adr-refs.mjs`) reads every tracked file and fails when one cites an id
that has no record here. It also fails when a record is not linked from this page.

## Two id spaces

| Shape | Scope | Where the record is |
|---|---|---|
| `ADR-NNN` — exactly three digits | the whole repository; each number is used once | `ADR-NNN-<slug>.md` in this directory |
| anything else — `ADR-2`, `ADR-1a`, `ADR-C4`, `ADR-PDF1` | one plan; several plans have their own `ADR-2` | one file per plan under [`plans/`](plans/), or the tracked plan itself under `.claude/tdd-guardian/` |

A plan-scoped id only means something next to the feature its plan built: `ADR-2` in
`src/stores/paneStore.ts` is the split-documents plan's, and `ADR-2` in `src-tauri/src/content_server/` is
the content-server plan's. The tables below say which plan built what. The gate proves a plan-scoped id is
defined by some plan; it cannot tell which plan a bare citation means, so name the feature or the plan
when you cite one.

## Repository-wide records

Each record is the text that was written when the decision was made, restored unedited, under a short
note saying where it came from and what enforces it today. Several were found not to describe the code by
a review on 2026-07-22, and their Status lines say so: read the Status line and the "Enforced by" note
before relying on one.

and ADR-014 (`.claude/rules/31-design-tokens.md`, where theme colours are defined).

## Plan-scoped records

Each file holds one plan's decisions, cut out of the plan unedited. The plans themselves are
maintainer-local (`dev-docs/plans/`), except the three that are tracked under `.claude/tdd-guardian/`,
which are linked in place.

## Adding a record

A decision that binds the whole repository gets the next free three-digit number:

1. Write `ADR-NNN-short-title.md` here. The first line is `# ADR-NNN: Title`; then a Status line, Context,
   Considered options, Decision, Consequences, and "Enforced by" — the gate, test or config that holds the
   decision, or a plain statement that nothing does.
2. Add its row to the table above.

A decision that belongs to one plan stays in the plan. If the plan is tracked under
`.claude/tdd-guardian/`, define the id there as a heading or a bold paragraph that starts with the id. If
the plan is maintainer-local and code cites its decisions, copy them to `plans/<plan file name>` with a
`> Defines:` line listing the ids, and add the row above.

When a decision is reversed, change the record's Status line and say what replaced it. Do not delete the
record while anything still cites it; the gate will say what does.
