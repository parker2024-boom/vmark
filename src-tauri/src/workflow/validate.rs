//! Split from `commands.rs` at the file-size gate, and it is a real seam:
//! nothing here reads or writes the managed state. `commands.rs` owns the
//! order that matters around it — gate, then claim, then this — while this
//! half is a pure function of the YAML and the workspace root, which is what
//! lets `commands.test.rs` drive every refusal without a Tauri runtime.
//!
//! The checks run cheapest-first, and that ORDER is the point of the size
//! bound: everything below it is read off a deserialized document.
//!
//! @coordinates-with commands.rs — `admit_run`, the only caller
//! @coordinates-with prepare.rs — `reject_dynamic_save_paths`, the last check
//! @module workflow::validate
