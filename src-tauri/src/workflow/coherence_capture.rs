//! Coherence capture for workflow `action/save-file` writes
//! (in-process, no IPC). The runner is the capture site: it knows the
//! step graph, so the input set is computed by walking template
//! references (`${{ steps.X... }}` and bare `X.output` aliases)
//! transitively from the save step to the `action/read-file` steps that
//! actually feed it — reachable reads become `direct` inputs; unrelated
//! reads never pollute the edge set (spec §7). Fire-and-forget: capture
//! failures log and never fail the workflow step.
//!
//! The capture honours `general.coherenceCaptureOnSave` (WI-LX1.4) like every
//! other write path: `run_workflow` passes the run's `CapturePolicy` to the
//! runner as an ARGUMENT, the runner hands it to each capture, and
//! `capture_with_policy` applies it — with the setting off and no ledger, a
//! save-file step creates no `.vmark/` and stamps nothing. A run that carried
//! no policy is treated as off. It used to ride in `WorkflowRunnerState`, an
//! app-global slot whose correctness rested on one-run-at-a-time.
