//! # File System Watcher
//!
//! Purpose: Watches workspace directories for external changes and notifies
//! the owning window via `fs:changed` batches so the file explorer and open
//! documents stay in sync.
//!
//! Pipeline: `start_watching` invoke → `notify` crate recursive watcher →
//! `signal_for` (classify + filter) → bounded queue → `batch::run_batch_loop`
//! on the watcher's batch thread → `emit_to(<window label>, "fs:changed", …)`
//! → frontend `services/workspaceEvents`.
//!
//! Key decisions:
//!   - Paths are reported under the root the caller asked to watch, not the
//!     realpath the OS returns (see `paths::rebase_onto_root`).
//!   - A watcher that lost track of the tree says so. A watcher error and the
//!     OS's own overflow report (`EventKind::Other` / the rescan flag) both
//!     become `Signal::Rescan`, which the frontend answers by re-listing.
//!   - Changes are batched per watcher (see `watcher/batch.rs`) and delivered
//!     only to the window that owns the watcher: every window runs its own
//!     watcher, so an app-global event woke every window for every change.
//!   - Specific noise directories (.git, node_modules, .obsidian) are filtered,
//!     but user-visible dot-dirs (.github, .vscode) are allowed through.
//!   - Each watcher is keyed by `watch_id`, which IS the owning window's label:
//!     it names both the registry entry and the event target.
//!   - `start_watching` is async — creating a recursive watcher walks the tree
//!     on some platforms and must not hold the IPC thread. That removes the
//!     serialization against the window-destroyed cleanup the IPC thread used
//!     to provide, so a watcher registered for a window that is already gone
//!     is removed again before the command returns.
//!
//! @coordinates-with watcher/batch.rs — the batching and the `fs:changed` payload
//! @coordinates-with watcher/paths.rs — the ignore list and root rebasing
//! @coordinates-with app_setup.rs — stops a window's watcher when it is destroyed
//! @module watcher
