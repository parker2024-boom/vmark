//! Finder/CLI file-open queueing and macOS reopen.
//!
//! Purpose: Owns cold-start file-open queueing, hot-open document-window
//! delivery, and the macOS `RunEvent::Opened` / `RunEvent::Reopen` handlers.
//!
//! fs-scope extension used to live here too and now lives in `fs_scope.rs` —
//! this file consumes it (`crate::allow_fs_read`) rather than owning it. It
//! moved when adding the recursive workspace grant (#1252) pushed this file
//! over the 300-line limit, which the size gate correctly refused.
//!
//! Key decisions:
//!   - A folder opened from Finder is a folder the user chose: it is granted
//!     and recorded through `workspace::grants` before its window opens.
//!   - `RunEvent::Opened` arrives on the event loop, and handling it touches
//!     the disk — classifying each URL, resolving and recording a folder, a
//!     grant file fsync. On a stale network mount any of those blocks for the
//!     mount's timeout, freezing every window, so the handler hands the whole
//!     batch to the blocking pool (`off_event_loop`) and returns. Two batches
//!     can then overlap; each routes its files atomically, as before.
//!   - File opens from Finder are queued in the app's `FileOpenStore` while a
//!     `main` window is booting, and drained by it when its frontend mounts,
//!     solving a cold-start race condition. When that window is destroyed the
//!     queue has no owner, and the next open brings a new one up instead of
//!     waiting for a window that is gone. Only files with a
//!     registered extension are accepted; others are skipped. Hot opens (app
//!     already running) target the last focused document window, attach that
//!     label to an `app.emit()` global broadcast, and bring the native window
//!     forward. Each frontend window filters the broadcast by target label.
//!   - macOS Reopen event (dock click) creates a new main window when none
//!     visible, restoring the user's most-recent workspace via
//!     `window_manager::pick_reopen_workspace_root` so closing the last tab and
//!     re-clicking the dock doesn't drop them into an orphan untitled doc.
