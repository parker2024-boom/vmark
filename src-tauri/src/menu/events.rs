//! # Menu Event Dispatcher
//!
//! Purpose: Routes native menu clicks to the correct frontend window and uses
//! listener readiness to seed Finder hot-open target selection.
//!
//! Pipeline: User clicks menu item → `handle_menu_event` (in
//! `events/dispatch.rs`) → emits `menu:{id}` to focused window.
//!
//! This file owns the window-readiness/queueing machinery and the event
//! constructors; id classification and per-action handlers live in the
//! `dispatch` child module, window lookups in the `windows` child module
//! (both under `menu/events/`, split out for the file-size ratchet).
//!
//! Key decisions:
//!   - Window readiness tracking prevents events from being lost during cold start.
//!     Events are queued until the frontend signals "ready", then flushed atomically.
//!   - Quit and Settings are handled entirely in Rust (no frontend round-trip needed).
//!   - Recent files/workspaces/genies resolve paths from snapshot Mutexes in `menu/mod.rs`
//!     to avoid TOCTOU races if the store changes between menu build and click.
//!   - "close" events include the target window label so the frontend can filter correctly.
//!   - The readiness queue is shared with quit (`deliver_when_ready`): a window
//!     still mounting has no listener for a quit request either, and one
//!     record of who is listening cannot disagree with itself.
//!
//! Known limitations:
//!   - On Windows, clicking a menu item can momentarily defocus the webview, so
//!     we fall back to "any document window" when no focused window is found.
