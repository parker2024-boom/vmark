//! Export-PDF window: built in Rust so it can be given an EMPTY menu.
//!
//! Key decision: this window is created here rather than from the frontend
//! (#1377). It used to be `new WebviewWindow("pdf-export", …)` in
//! `services/navigation/pdfExportWindow.ts`, and Tauri's JS window options
//! carry no `menu` field — so on Linux and Windows, where the menu bar belongs
//! to each window rather than to the app, a 440x640 utility dialog opened with
//! the whole File/Edit/Format/Insert/View/Help bar attached. None of those
//! actions apply to it.
//!
//! The Settings window never had that problem because it is built in Rust and
//! passes `.menu(Menu::new(app)?)` — an empty menu — under
//! `cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))`. That is the mechanism, and this file exists
//! to reuse it.
//!
//! On macOS the menu bar is app-global, so there is nothing to suppress and no
//! `.menu()` call — passing one there would replace the application menu.
//!
//! Key decision: `(async)`, like every other window-creating command here. A
//! sync command runs on the thread that delivered the IPC message, which on
//! Windows is inside WebView2's `WebMessageReceived` callback, and building a
//! webview there is the reentrancy case WebView2 forbids (#1301, #1302). See
//! `window_manager/mod.rs`.
//!
//! Key decision: the singleton is CLOSE-then-recreate, not focus-existing. The
//! window renders one specific document's HTML, handed to it as a temp-file
//! path, so re-focusing a stale one would show the previous export. This
//! preserves the behaviour the TypeScript had.
//!
//! Key decision: the recreate WAITS for the close. `close()` only posts a
//! request, and the label stays registered until Tauri delivers `Destroyed`;
//! building before that fails with `WindowLabelAlreadyExists`. The wait is
//! bounded and its expiry is an error the caller sees. The label itself stays
//! fixed — the capability file, the progress events, the window-state denylist
//! and the page's own close handler all address the window by this name — and
//! the build goes through `ensure_window` like every other fixed label.
//!
//! @coordinates-with services/navigation/pdfExportWindow.ts — the caller
//! @coordinates-with pdf_export/renderer/progress.rs — PROGRESS_WINDOW is this label
//! @coordinates-with window_creation.rs — check-and-build as one step
