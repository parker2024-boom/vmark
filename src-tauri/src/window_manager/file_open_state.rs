//! Finder/CLI file-open decision state: the queue's owner, the pending queue,
//! workspace grouping, and the atomic queue-vs-emit decision.
//!
//! Key decision: file opens from Finder are grouped by workspace root so
//! multiple files in the same directory open as tabs in a single window.
//!
//! Key decision: "queue and wait" is tied to the LIFE of the window that will
//! drain the queue ([`QueueOwner`]). Only `main` drains it, once, when its
//! frontend mounts; a bare "not ready yet" flag kept saying "wait" after that
//! window had been destroyed, and every later open was queued behind a window
//! that no longer existed.
