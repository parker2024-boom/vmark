//! Per-file asset-protocol access grants for the media viewer.
//!
//! Media tabs never read their file as text, so they skip the `readTextFile`
//! path that extends the scopes for text documents. The frontend calls
//! `grant_asset_access` before mounting the media surface so `convertFileSrc`
//! (asset://) can serve the file instead of returning 403.
//!
//! Threat model (WI-LX1.2). The asset-protocol scope in `tauri.conf.json` is
//! the fs capability's static roots — `$HOME/**`, `/Volumes/**`, `/mnt/**`,
//! `/media/**`, plus `C:\` to `F:\` on Windows via `tauri.windows.conf.json`
//! (pinned by `capabilities.test.rs`). Until 0.9.84 it was `**/*`, which matched
//! every absolute path without a dot component, so this gate guarded nothing.
//! It is now the boundary: this command is invocable from webview JS, so an
//! injected script could otherwise grant itself asset:// read of ANY path
//! (e.g. `/etc/passwd`) and exfiltrate it. Grants are therefore restricted to
//! files whose extension is a previewable media type — the only thing the
//! media viewer ever legitimately needs.
//!
//! The extension judged is the TARGET's: Tauri also allows the canonical form
//! of whatever it grants, so a link named `secret.png` would otherwise grant
//! the file it points at. The canonical target is what is checked and what is
//! granted, and the grant is confirmed afterwards (`fs_scope::
//! confirm_grant_target`): a target swapped for a link during the grant call
//! fails the grant, and — as that function states — the stray allow it caused
//! lasts until restart, because revoking it could revoke a file the user
//! opened.
//!
//! The grant is asset-protocol ONLY. The media viewer loads over asset:// and
//! nothing else, and a runtime fs grant would be accepted by every fs command
//! the capability permits, write and remove included (`fs_scope.rs`).
//!
//! What it does NOT bound is WHICH media file: any image, video or audio file
//! the user can read, anywhere on disk, is readable over asset://.
