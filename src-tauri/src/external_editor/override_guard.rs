//! Editor-override boundary guard.
//!
//! Purpose: stop `open_in_external_editor`'s `editor_override` from being a
//! process-execution primitive. The command runs `<override> <file>`; both
//! come from the webview (the override is the Settings value, sent over IPC),
//! and VMark opens `sh`/`py`/`rb`/`js` files — so an override naming an
//! interpreter or a shell does not open the file, it RUNS it.
//!
//! Key decisions:
//!   - One token, never split into a program and arguments. Arguments belong
//!     in `$VMARK_EXTERNAL_EDITOR`, which the webview cannot set.
//!   - A bare name is looked up on PATH, so it must be an editor VMark knows
//!     by name ([`KNOWN_EDITORS`]). "Any single word" is how `python3` got in.
//!   - An absolute path must exist, must not detour through `..` or end in a
//!     separator, and neither the name it is spelled with nor the name it
//!     RESOLVES to (links followed) may be something that runs its argument
//!     ([`RUNS_ITS_ARGUMENT`]). Resolving is what stops a link called `code`
//!     that points at `/bin/sh`.
//!   - Refusals the user can act on are localized; they reach a toast.
//!
//! What this does NOT enforce — the same residual `ai_provider/cli_path_guard`
//! states: it cannot tell a real editor from a program planted under an
//! innocent name, and [`RUNS_ITS_ARGUMENT`] is a list of known offenders, a
//! floor rather than a proof. Telling those apart needs to know WHO is asking,
//! which no Tauri command can.
//!
//! @coordinates-with external_editor.rs — the only caller
//! @coordinates-with ai_provider/cli_path_guard.rs — the same guard for `cli_path`
//! @module external_editor/override_guard
