//! The staging file a render writes, published onto the output only on a
//! delivered success.
//!
//! Purpose: the platforms used to print straight to the caller's output
//! path. A render that outlived its caller's timeout — WebView2's
//! `PrintToPdf` and WebKitGTK's `print` complete on their own schedule, and
//! nothing cancels them — then wrote that path AFTER the command had reported
//! failure, on top of whatever a retry had just produced. Rendering to a
//! sibling file nobody else names, and renaming it into place only once the
//! outcome has been DELIVERED, means the output path changes on a confirmed
//! success and at no other moment; a late writer only ever fills a file the
//! sink deletes on arrival (`sink.rs`).
//!
//! A sibling, not a `temp_dir()` file: `rename` must not cross a filesystem,
//! and the output directory is the one place already validated to exist —
//! which on macOS is also what keeps AppKit from spooling the document to a
//! printer (`mod.rs`).
//!
//! `remove_temp` lives here too: it is how every private file of a render —
//! the temp document and this staging file — is deleted, by the sink, the
//! wait and the publish alike.
//!
//! @coordinates-with sink.rs — removes the file on every path but a delivered Ok
//! @coordinates-with wait.rs — publishes it on that path
//! @coordinates-with atomic_persist.rs — the directory sync that makes the rename durable
//! @module pdf_export/renderer/staging
