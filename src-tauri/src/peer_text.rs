//! How text chosen OUTSIDE this process is allowed to reach a log line or the UI.
//!
//! Purpose: one rule for every string Rust did not write itself — an MCP
//! client's envelope `type`/`id` and `identify` name, a webview's command
//! arguments and event payloads, a path handed over by Finder or argv.
//! Interpolating one into a log with `{}` lets it carry NEWLINES — so its
//! author can write log lines of their own, in VMark's own format, and a
//! reader cannot tell them from the app's. Nothing bounds them either,
//! so a megabyte value is a megabyte of log.
//!
//! Three answers, because the destinations want different things:
//!
//!   - [`peer_text`] is for a short TOKEN in a log (a label, an id, a type).
//!     `{:?}` on a `str` escapes a newline to `\n`, a quote to `\"` and
//!     anything unprintable — a carriage return, the `ESC` that starts a
//!     terminal colour sequence — to `\u{…}`, so the value can only ever be
//!     one token on one line.
//!   - [`peer_message`] is the same escaping for free-form DIAGNOSTIC text
//!     (a frontend milestone line, an error message, a path). Its bound is
//!     wider, because cutting a diagnostic at token length would throw away
//!     the part a reader needs.
//!   - [`peer_label`] is for a value VMark stores and shows (the client name in
//!     Settings → Integrations). Quoting would be wrong there, so control
//!     characters are removed instead.
//!
//! All three bound the length, with a marker, so a truncated value cannot be
//! mistaken for a short one.
//!
//! A path is the same kind of text — a file name may hold a newline — and is
//! logged with `{:?}`, which quotes and escapes it; its length is the
//! filesystem's to bound. `log_escaping.test.rs` is the gate: no log call in
//! the production tree passes `path.display()` or wraps a `{}` in quotes of
//! its own.
//!
//! @coordinates-with mcp_bridge/server.rs — the envelope log
//! @coordinates-with mcp_bridge/identify.rs — the client-supplied identity
