//! The atomic publication step, and the ONE Windows replacement rule.
//!
//! Purpose: split out of `atomic_replace.rs` when it gained a second consumer
//! (audit 20260907 #389). `mcp_bridge::token_file` publishes the bridge's
//! discovery credential the same way but cannot use `atomic_write_file` — that
//! writer preserves the TARGET's permissions, which is right for a user
//! document and wrong for a secret. Reaching into `atomic_replace` for the
//! helper would have made a document writer the home of a credential writer's
//! rule; a neutral module is what both can share.
//!
//! Sharing it is not tidiness. Both call sites carried the same DESTRUCTIVE
//! Windows fallback — `remove_file(target)` then retry, on the false premise
//! that Windows `rename` refuses an existing target — and fixing one copy
//! left the other live for a year. One rule, one place.
//!
//! Publication is two steps, and both live here: the rename that swaps the
//! new file in, and the sync of the parent directory that makes the rename
//! survive a crash (see `persist_with_retry`). A writer whose file is not a
//! `NamedTempFile` — the PDF renderer's staging file — does its own rename and
//! takes the second step from [`sync_parent_directory`].
//!
//! @coordinates-with atomic_replace.rs — the document writer
//! @coordinates-with mcp_bridge/token_file.rs — the credential writer
//! @coordinates-with pdf_export/renderer/staging.rs — syncs the output's directory
//! @module atomic_persist
