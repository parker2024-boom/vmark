//! What a scan remembers about the markdown files it already read.
//!
//! Purpose: every `fs:changed` burst runs a reconciliation scan, and a scan
//! used to read and hash every `.md` in the workspace (up to 20k files) to
//! learn that almost all of them had not changed. The kernel keeps, per
//! workspace-relative path, the facts a scan derived from the file's content
//! — its frontmatter identity and, once computed, its content hash — keyed by
//! a stamp of the file's metadata. A file whose stamp is unchanged is not
//! read again; its facts are reused.
//!
//! Key decisions:
//!   - The stamp is size + modification time, plus on Unix the inode and the
//!     status-change time. The ctime cannot be set from user space, so a tool
//!     that restores an old mtime after rewriting a file still changes the
//!     stamp; the inode catches a replace-by-rename.
//!   - When in doubt, read. A file modified within `MTIME_SLACK` of the moment
//!     it was stamped is never remembered: another write in the same
//!     timestamp tick would leave the stamp unchanged (filesystems with 1-2 s
//!     mtime granularity), so such a file is read on every scan until it has
//!     been quiet for a while.
//!   - Facts are purely a function of the file's bytes, so nothing about the
//!     ledger or the index invalidates them. Paths the walk no longer sees
//!     (deleted, renamed away, now excluded) are dropped after each walk.
//!   - In memory only, per kernel: a restart starts from nothing.
//!
//! @coordinates-with scan_walk.rs — consults and fills the cache while walking
//! @coordinates-with scan.rs — fills in content hashes as reconciliation computes them
//! @module coherence/scan_cache
