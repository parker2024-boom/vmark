# Shared assertion helpers for the plan DoD checkers (scripts/check-*-phase.sh).
# Source it AFTER `set -uo pipefail` and after `cd`-ing to the tree under test:
# it defines the PASS/FAIL/UNVERIFIED counters, the ok/fail/unverified
# reporters, and one assert_* per assertion kind.
#
# Text assertions match FIXED STRINGS (`grep -F`): callers pass filenames and
# code fragments, where `.`, `(` and `+` are literals and a regex near-miss
# (`baselineXjson` for `baseline.json`) must not pass. Regex is the explicit
# `_E` / `_Ei` variants, written in POSIX ERE (`[[:space:]]`, never `\s`), so
# the result does not depend on which grep is installed.

# Syntax-aware probes (scripts/dod-syntax.mjs): grep sees text, these see CODE.
# TS/JS goes through the TypeScript parser, Rust through a lexer that blanks
# comments and literals — a `#[path]` in a block comment, an `it(` inside a
# template literal, a call site in a doc comment satisfied the greps these
# replaced (audit 20260907 #26/#27/#31/#32) and satisfy nothing now.
DOD_SYNTAX="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)/dod-syntax.mjs"
# Every probe goes through `dod_syntax`, which answers from ONE long-lived
# `dod-syntax.mjs --serve` per shell instead of a node per probe: loading the
# TypeScript compiler costs ~0.36s, and a phase issues dozens of probes (the
# feature-ledger phase 5 spent 11s starting processes, and its self-test took
# eleven minutes).
#
# The transport is one request/reply stream with no request ids, so it is
# correct only while ONE process talks to it. Four rules keep it that way, and
# each is a way it used to return a wrong answer:
#   - Only the shell that started the server (BASH_SUBSHELL 0) uses it.
#     Subshells inherit the descriptors, and a pipeline stage or background job
#     runs CONCURRENTLY with its parent — two callers on one stream consumed
#     each other's replies, or deadlocked. Every subshell takes a fresh process.
#   - A working directory or argument holding LF, CR or U+001F cannot ride the
#     line protocol (node's readline ends a line at a lone CR too); it takes a
#     fresh process rather than splitting into two requests and leaving a
#     stale reply to poison the next probe.
#   - The server must answer a `--ping` before it is trusted, and one that dies
#     is closed and never used again: that probe, and every later one, runs in
#     a fresh process. Probes are read-only, so the retry is safe.
#   - The descriptors are the first free ones at or above 10 (where bash's own
#     `{var}` allocation starts — unavailable in the bash 3.2 macOS ships), not
#     a fixed 7/8 that silently took over a caller's own.
#
# And no open of the reply FIFO may BLOCK, on either end (#1473). A plain
# open of a FIFO waits for the other end, and in bash 3.2 the reader's wait
# fails with EINTR whenever a child exits meanwhile — measured at 7 of 120
# runs under 8-way load, 0 of 60 with bash 5.3. The server's write-only open
# then waited FOREVER for a reader that had given up, and the shell forked for
# it held every descriptor it inherited: the caller's own stdout and stderr,
# which bash parks at fd 10+ while a function such as `has_test_case … >/dev/null
# 2>&1` runs. So the checker exited, yet whoever read its output (a test's
# spawnSync) never saw end-of-file and hung. Now the READER opens first, and
# neither of its opens can wait: read-write returns at once (Linux and macOS
# both define it for a FIFO), and read-only then has that writer. The server's
# write-only open then finds readers already there and cannot wait either. The
# server stays WRITE-ONLY: one that could read its own reply FIFO never got
# EPIPE, so when its caller left mid-reply it blocked for ever on a full pipe.

# The FILE is taken after the LAST `|`, not the first. A fixed-string pattern
# may legitimately contain a pipe — a markdown table row, an alternation
# written into prose, a `Result<T, String> | CommandError` — and splitting at
# the first separator made the pattern everything before it and the "file"
# everything after, so the probe reported "no match" for a file it never
# opened. A path containing a pipe is still not expressible; that is
# reported by `assert_any` rather than guessed at.
#
# `nogrep` branches on grep's STATUS: shell negation turns an execution error
# (exit 2 — unreadable file, no grep) into a PASS, so `assert_any` would accept
# evidence it never gathered. Only exit 1, the explicit
# "no match", is the absence this probe claims.
