 * Markdown or HTML inside the cell (audit 20260907 #79); a value shown as code
 * goes through `codeSpan`, whose fence outlasts any backtick run inside. All
 * of it comes from the spine JSON and the CLI, not from anything this module
 * measured.
 *
 * EVERY value, including `defaultsRel`, which is interpolated twice — once in
 * prose and once inside a table CELL. Both sites wrote it between hand-typed
 * backticks, so a backtick in the path would have closed the span early and a
 * `|` would have split the provenance row: the module's own rule, applied
 * everywhere except the two places it was easiest to forget.

Generated by \`node scripts/gen-feature-ledger.mjs\` from \`scripts/feature-map.json\`.
**Do not hand-edit.** Every number below is joined from something this repo
already measures; nothing here is estimated, scored, or graded. The qualitative
companion — what each feature does, how it is reached and gated, what is known
to be unwired or stale — is the hand-inspected \`.claude/feature-ledger.md\`,
which cites these cells.

- \`--\` means **not measured**, which is not the same claim as \`0\`.

A cell reads `-- (n/m files)` when the summary holds only some of the feature's coverage-eligible files. `vitest.config.ts` sets `coverage.include`, so a full run lists every src file, untested ones at 0%; a summary written before that, or under another coverage config, can lack some, and a fraction is not the feature."

| Feature | Code | Src files | Test files | Test:code | Line cov | Oversized | Mocks | Layering | Coupling | Commits | Last touch | Gate |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|---|
${rows.map((r) => row(r, covPresent)).join("\n")}

### Column provenance

| Column | Joined from | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Code | \`tokei\`, tests excluded | lines of code (blanks/comments excluded) |
| Src / Test files | \`find\` over \`.ts/.tsx/.rs\` | file count |
| Test:code | test lines ÷ code lines | ratio, not a quality claim |
| Line cov | \`coverage/coverage-summary.json\` | covered ÷ total lines over the feature's coverage-eligible files; \`--\` unless every one is in the summary |
| Oversized | \`scripts/file-size-baseline.json\` | files frozen over the 300-line limit |
| Mocks | \`scripts/mock-boundaries-baseline.json\` | internal modules faked by this feature's tests |
| Layering | \`.dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json\` | frozen import-rule violations originating here |
| Coupling | \`scripts/plugin-store-coupling-baseline.json\` | plugin→host edges |
| Commits / Last touch | \`git log\` | count in window; ISO date |
| Gate | \`scripts/feature-map.json\`, verified against ${codeSpan(defaultsRel)} | setting key = shipped default |

Each file is measured under exactly ONE feature — the most specific spine claim
that covers it (\`scripts/check-feature-map.mjs\` enforces the same rule), so
Code, Src files, Test files, Oversized, Mocks and Layering add up across rows to
the feature-owned total. Nothing else does: Test:code and Line cov are ratios,
Last touch is a date, Coupling is joined by plugin name, and Commits counts
history, where a commit that touches two features counts under both. Files in
\`infrastructure.paths\` belong to no row, so no total includes them.

## Undocumented features

Features with no \`website/guide\` page in the spine:

${rows.filter((r) => !r.doc).map((r) => `- ${escapeCell(r.name)} (${n(r.code)} lines of code)`).join("\n") || "- none"}

## What this table deliberately does NOT contain

No score, grade, priority, target date, or owner. \`scripts/baseline-review-schedule.json\`
records what happened last time dates were invented for a file like this one and
stamped with somebody else's name. Judgement about what to strengthen belongs in
prose that cites these cells — that prose is \`.claude/feature-ledger.md\`,
written by a person and revisited when the numbers move.
