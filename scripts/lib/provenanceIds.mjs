/**
 * Provenance ids in production comments — what they are and whether they
 * resolve. The pure half of `scripts/check-provenance-ids.mjs`.
 *
 * Purpose: a production comment may say WHY a line exists by citing where the
 * decision was made — a work item (`WI-RA27.1`) or a dated audit
 * (`audit 20260907 #84`). Such a citation is only worth its place if a reader
 * of a fresh clone can follow it. This module finds the citations and decides,
 * offline and from tracked files alone, which of them can be followed.
 *
 * Resolution (a token that does not resolve is a finding):
 *   - A NAMESPACED work item (`WI-RA27.1`, `WI-RA17E.5`, letters after `WI-`)
 *     resolves when exactly one tracked plan mentions it, or when a tracked
 *     plan that mentions it is named in the same file's comments.
 *   - A BARE work item (`WI-<n>.<m>`, digits straight after `WI-`) resolves
 *     only when a tracked plan that mentions it is named in the same file's
 *     comments. Every plan numbers its items from 1, so a bare id with no
 *     plan beside it names a dozen plans at once — or, when the plan it came
 *     from was never tracked, a different plan's item that happens to share
 *     the number.
 *   - An AUDIT citation — `audit` followed by an identifier (`audit
 *     20260907 #84`, `audit R<n> #<n>`, `audit-fix H<n>`, `audit round <n>`) —
 *     resolves when it carries a date and a tracked audit record for that date
 *     exists (`.cc-suite/audits/`, `.claude/tdd-guardian/audit-*`). An
 *     undated citation names no record at all.
 *   - `audit #480` alone (only `#N` after the word) is an ISSUE reference:
 *     audit findings were filed as `[audit]` GitHub issues, so it is reported
 *     as kind `issue` and, like every issue number, not judged here.
 *   - Tracked plans are `.claude/tdd-guardian/*.md` and `.claude/adr/plans/*.md`.
 *     `dev-docs/` is maintainer-local (gitignored): a clone cannot read it, so
 *     it never makes a token resolve.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Commit history is NOT a resolver. A commit subject tagged `(WI-<n>)` is
 *     one of dozens with that tag, and history depends on how the tree was
 *     cloned; a gate that reads it gives different answers on different
 *     machines. Plans and audit records are files in the tree, so the verdict
 *     is a function of the checkout alone.
 *   - Issue numbers (`#1081`) are not checked: deciding whether an issue
 *     exists needs the network, and whether its title fits the comment needs
 *     judgment. A `#N` inside an audit citation is part of that citation.
 *   - Test files are out of scope: a test header is where a WI id belongs
 *     (`scripts/check-wi-linkage.sh` reads it there).
 *   - The tooling is in scope (`TOOLING_TREES`), shell scripts included: a
 *     gate's comment that cites an id a clone cannot resolve leaves the
 *     contributor it blocks without the reason.
 *
