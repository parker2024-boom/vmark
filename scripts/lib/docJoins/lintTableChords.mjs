 *
 * The prose matcher and the token reader share ONE vocabulary of modifiers and
 * named keys, so a chord the matcher finds is a chord the reader can check.

/**
 * The docs spelling of a token list, produced BY `prosemirrorToDocs` rather
 * than by a second copy of its rule.
 *
 * The copy had already drifted, in the direction that matters: it upper-cased
 * a single ASCII letter (`t.length === 1 && /[a-z]/i`), while the renderer it
 * is compared against upper-cases any single Unicode LETTER by CODE POINT
 * (`/^\p{L}$/u` — audit 20260907 #91 fixed that side and not this one). So a
 * chord on a non-ASCII or astral key rendered one way by the shortcut
 * definition and another way by the page reader, and a page carrying the
 * CORRECT chord would have been reported stale.
 *
 * Round-tripping through the ProseMirror spelling is what makes one rule serve
 * both: `chordTokens` rejects empty tokens and multi-character tokens that are
 * not named keys, so `join("-")` is unambiguous — the minus KEY re-reads as the
 * `Mod--` form `keyTokens` already understands.
