/**
 * Header-reference comment scanning and tag grammar — the reading
 * half of `scripts/lib/headerReferences.mjs`.
 *
 * Purpose: find the comment lines of a source file and the three reference
 * tags they can carry (`@coordinates-with <target>`, `@module <self-path>`,
 * `Plan: <file>`). It decides nothing about whether a reference resolves; that
 * is `headerReferences.mjs` and `headerReferenceTargets.mjs`.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Comment scanning is BLOCK-AWARE: a `*`-prefixed line counts only inside
 *     a block comment whose opening `/*` starts a line — and it runs over the
 *     source with every LITERAL blanked first (`literalsBlanked`): TypeScript
 *     and JavaScript through the TypeScript parser (strings, template heads /
 *     middles / tails, regexes, JSX text), Rust through `rustSource.mjs`. So a
 *     header quoted inside a test's template literal is never read as the
 *     test's own header, however its lines start, and a `@generated` quoted in
 *     one cannot skip the file that quotes it (audit 20260907 #84 — with the
 *     line model alone, a `/*` that opened a line inside a template literal was
 *     a comment, and a `@generated` there within the first 20 lines skipped
 *     every real header in the file). A hand-rolled backtick tokenizer was
 *     rejected for the reason the parser is right: a stray backtick flips its
 *     parity and every header after it goes silently unread. The parser is
 *     invoked only for a source that contains a backtick — a single-line
 *     literal cannot put `/*` or `//` at the start of a line, so the files
 *     that need it are the ones that can hold a multi-line literal.
 *   - A file is GENERATED (skipped) only when a comment line in its first 20
 *     lines starts with `@generated` — not the word in a string, a template
 *     literal or prose.
 *
 * @coordinates-with scripts/lib/headerReferences.mjs — resolves and compares what this reads
 * @coordinates-with scripts/lib/rustSource.mjs — blanks Rust literals before the comment scan
 * @coordinates-with scripts/check-header-references.test.mjs — drives every grammar here
 * @module scripts/lib/headerComments
