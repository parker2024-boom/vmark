/**
 * Eager-chunk regression gate (extended to walk the static-import closure).
 *
 * "Lazy chunk became eager" regressions were previously invisible: a stray
 * static import drags a heavyweight chunk onto the cold-start path and nothing
 * fails.
 *
 * WHAT THE EXTENSION CHANGED — and why the previous version could not have caught
 * anything under App. The gate used to read `dist/index.html` alone. Vite emits
 * `<link rel=modulepreload>` only for the ENTRY chunk's static import graph;
 * `src/main.tsx` reaches the application through `await import("./App")` inside
 * `bootstrap()`, so every chunk under App is fetched at cold start but appears
 * nowhere in index.html. Measured on the build before it: App statically
 * imported the xyflow chunk, which statically imports vendor-mermaid (2.4 MB),
 * which statically imports vendor-graph (660 kB) — three denylisted-or-heavy
 * chunks on the boot path, with `lint:eager` green. The HTML list was never the
 * cold-start graph; it was the prefix of it that Vite happens to annotate.
 *
 * So the gate now walks the real thing: the static-import closure of
 * dist/assets, seeded from BOTH the HTML's eager assets AND the boot chunks
 * named in BOOT_CHUNK_PATTERNS. A boot chunk is one the entry awaits
 * unconditionally before first paint; App is the only one today, and the
 * pattern is spelled out here rather than inferred so that renaming it fails
 * the gate closed instead of silently emptying the seed set.
 *
 * HTML parsing stays attribute-order and quote-style agnostic (Codex audit: a
 * rel/href reorder or quote change in Vite's output must not silently disable
 * the gate). Both `<link rel=modulepreload href>` and `<script src>` count.
 *
 * Run after `pnpm build` (wired into check:all as lint:eager).
 * Helpers are exported for scripts/check-eager-chunks.test.ts.
 *

/**
 * Lazy-only chunks — app-source modules that must reach the app ONLY through a dynamic
 * import, checked by existence AND by closure membership.
 *
 * The DENYLIST above cannot express this class. It matches chunk NAMES, and a
 * vendor family keeps its name whether it is eager or lazy — but an app module
 * that regresses to a static import stops being a chunk at all: rolldown
 * merges it into its importer, the name vanishes from dist/assets, and a
 * name-matching gate reports "clean" precisely when the regression happened.
 * That is the same fail-open shape `BOOT_CHUNK_PATTERNS` exists to close.
 *
 * So each pattern is checked twice: the chunk must EXIST (a missing one means
 * a static import inlined it) and must NOT be statically reachable at cold
 * start (a present one may still have been pulled onto the boot graph).
 *
 * All seven are format-registry surfaces. `bootstrapFormats()` runs in every
 * window — Settings, PDF export — before `import("./App")`, so an adapter's
 * static import is cold-start cost for windows that never open an editor.
 * Measured before these were made lazy: 4.52 MB across 71 chunks, of which the
 * markdown WYSIWYG surface and the GHA workflow machinery were ~0.66 MB.
 *
 * NOT covered here, deliberately: `vendor-codemirror` and `vendor-tiptap`.
 * Both remain on the cold-start closure through paths outside the format
 * registry that this gate's own walk exposes — App's static graph reaches
 * @tiptap/pm through lintEngine → utils/headingSlug, and every chunk holding a
 * dynamic import reaches vendor-codemirror through the vite preload helper
 * (see scripts/manualChunks.ts). Listing them would be a gate that can never
 * go green rather than one that catches a regression.

 * chunks into their importers, so `entry` went 14.6 → 185 kB while the
 * closure went 3.05 → 3.09 MiB. This bounds what launch actually loads,
 * whatever shape the bundler gives it. ~5% above the measured 3.09 MiB.
 *
 * Lowered 3,407,872 → 3,384,010 bytes when the markdown paste extension and
 * turndown stopped being reachable from App-side code (they moved out of the
 * cold-start popupComponents chunk into the lazy markdownSurface chunk). The
 * measured closure went 3,246,541 → 3,223,808 bytes; the headroom ratio over
 * the measurement is unchanged (1.0497).
 *
 * Lowered 3,384,010 → 3,310,399 bytes when classic zod left the App chunk
 * (the hot-exit schemas use `zod/mini`) and the JSON tree view left the entry
 * chunk for a lazy one. The measured closure went 3,223,808 → 3,153,662
 * bytes; same ratio again.
 *
 * Lowered 3,310,399 → 3,305,484 bytes when smol-toml left the entry chunk for
 * the lazy `vendor-toml` chunk (the TOML parser now loads on first use). The
 * measured closure is 3,148,980 bytes; same ratio again.
