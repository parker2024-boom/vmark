/**
 * The ratchet manifest: every committed baseline, and what "loosening" means
 * for each one. Data, deliberately separated from the engine that reads it
 * (scripts/baselineRatchetModes.mjs) and the CLI that reports it
 * (scripts/check-baseline-ratchet.mjs) — this file changes whenever a gate is
 * added, the other two almost never.
 *
 * REGISTERING A NEW BASELINE IS PART OF ADDING ONE. A baseline-shaped file on
 * disk that is missing here fails the gate, and an entry here whose file is
 * gone fails too; see the discovery globs in the CLI's header.
 *
 * Entry schema:
 *   path      repo-relative path
 *   format    "json" (default) or "text" (compared by a custom comparator)
 *   checks    one or more:
 *     { mode: "scalar",        at }                    raising the number fails
 *     { mode: "per-key-count", at, onAdd }             raising any count fails;
 *                                                      nested maps flatten to
 *                                                      dotted keys; a NEW key
 *                                                      is a raise from 0 under
 *                                                      onAdd "fail"
 *     { mode: "identity",      at, shape, key?, onAdd } a SET; "strings" |
 *                                                      "objects" (with `key`
 *                                                      fields) | "object-keys"
 *     { mode: "custom",        comparator, onAdd }     a named comparator
 *   `at` is a dotted path; "" is the document itself. An `at` ending in `.*`
 *   expands to one check per key of that object, read from the file itself at
 *   comparison time — for a baseline keyed by something the manifest should
 *   not have to restate (the theme catalog).
 *   `onAdd` is "fail" for lists whose own contract forbids additions, else
 *   "report" — additions are visible in the diff; raises and swaps are not.
 *   Every per-file COUNT baseline here is "fail": each of those gates already
 *   refuses a new dirty file, so a key added to the baseline in the same
 *   change is the self-attestation this script exists to catch. A rename that
 *   carries old debt under a new key is declared with an allowRaise from 0.
 *
 * allowRaise entries permit exactly ONE re-measurement each and expire by
 * themselves: the declared from→to must match what actually happened, a reason
 * is mandatory, and the entry FAILS AS STALE once the base already carries the
 * raised value.
