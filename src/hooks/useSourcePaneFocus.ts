/**
 * useSourcePaneFocus — focused-pane gating for the Source editors (#1081).
 *
 * Returns a ref the creation effect reads to decide whether to register itself
 * as the active source view, and runs a reactive effect that re-registers when
 * split focus moves to this pane (the creation effect fires only once). No-op
 * in single-pane (always focused). Extracted from SourceEditor to keep it lean.
 *
 * Two editors use it (WI-LX2.4). The markdown `SourceEditor` registers with
 * the window's active tab and publishes the markdown cursor context. The
 * split-pane `SourcePane` (yaml, json, toml, …) used to register NOTHING, so
 * every reader of `editorStore.active.activeSourceView` — the workflow
 * diagnostics banner's line jump, `JobNode`'s Escape, undo in source mode, the
 * IME guard — found no view, or a stale one from another document. It now
 * registers under its OWN tab (`options.tabId`) and skips the cursor context,
 * which is markdown-only (`options.cursorContext: false`) — and DROPS any
 * markdown context another pane published, so the toolbar and context menu
 * (which act on `source.editorView`) cannot format that pane's document while
 * this one is focused.
 *
 * The registration lasts only while the pane is focused and visible:
 * focus moving to a pane with no source editor — a preview, a
 * media viewer, a WYSIWYG pane — forgets this view by identity, as the Tiptap
 * registration does, instead of leaving lint, IME and selection readers
 * aimed at a document the user left.
 *

 * @coordinates-with hooks/useIsFocusedPane.ts — focus resolution
