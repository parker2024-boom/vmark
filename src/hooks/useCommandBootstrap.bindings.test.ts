// Runs under jsdom, the default: registerAllCommands pulls in viewCommands,
// which imports contentServerStore — that publishes a DEV debug handle on
// `window` at import time.
/**
 * Every menu binding must name a command that exists (audit #916).
 *
 * `executeCommand` answers `false` for BOTH "no such command" and "`when()`
 * said no", so at dispatch time a dead menu item is indistinguishable from a
 * disabled one — it simply does nothing, forever, and nothing says so. The
 * mount-time preflight in `mountMenuCommands` now catches it: an unresolvable
 * binding is dropped and readiness reports `false`.
 *
 * That makes this property load-bearing, and a property nothing asserts is a
 * property that breaks quietly. Editor-action bindings are excluded because
 * they never touch the bus — they dispatch through `runEditorAction`.
