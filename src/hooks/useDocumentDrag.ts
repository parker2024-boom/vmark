/**
 * useDocumentDrag
 *
 * Purpose: the document-level half of a drag gesture — follow the pointer after
 * a press on some handle, and guarantee that everything the gesture installed
 * is removed when it ends, however it ends.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - One session at a time, owned by a ref. Starting a drag while one is
 *     still attached (its release was delivered outside the window and never
 *     reached the document) ends the old one first, so listeners never stack.
 *   - Attach and detach are written adjacently in `attach()`, which returns the
 *     teardown for exactly what it installed. Two lists in two functions drift:
 *     a listener added to one and forgotten in the other leaks for the lifetime
 *     of the window with nothing looking wrong.
 *   - A drag ends on release, on pointer cancel, on window blur (the user
 *     switched away mid-drag and the release will never arrive) and on unmount.
 *     `onEnd` runs exactly once per session, AFTER the listeners are gone, and
 *     is told why — callers decide what a blur or an unmount should commit.
 *   - Body cursor and user-select are set only when the caller asks for a
 *     cursor, and restored only by the session that set them, so a hook with no
 *     drag in progress cannot clear another resizer's styles on unmount.
 *   - The returned controls are referentially stable, so they are safe in
 *     dependency arrays.
 *
 * @coordinates-with hooks/useSidebarResize.ts — sidebar edge drag
 * @coordinates-with components/Terminal/useTerminalResize.ts — terminal panel edge drag
 * @coordinates-with hooks/useTabDragOut.ts — tab reorder / drag-out (pointer events)
 * @module hooks/useDocumentDrag
