/**
 * The edit slice's queue algebra — pure functions over `EditSlice`.
 *
 * Purpose: `workflowStore.ts` is the store's WIRING; deciding what a patch
 * queue looks like after an operation is a separate concern with no Zustand in
 * it, and it had grown to the point of pushing that file past its size cap.
 * Everything here is a pure transformation: same input, same output, no reads
 * of any other store.
 *
 * The model: ONE document is bound at a time, its queue is `pendingPatches`,
 * and `patchesByDocument` mirrors it plus every other document's stash. The
 * mirror is the invariant the rest depends on — `patchesByDocument[bound]`
 * equals `pendingPatches` whenever that queue is non-empty, and the key is
 * absent when it is empty.
 *
 * @coordinates-with src/stores/workflowStore.ts — the only consumer
 * @coordinates-with src/lib/ghaWorkflow/save/mutators.ts — IRPatch
 * @module stores/workflowEditQueue
