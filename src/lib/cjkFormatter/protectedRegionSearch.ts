/**
 * The one containment test the protected-region detectors share.
 *
 * Purpose: every detector guards its match START against the regions claimed
 * before it, which is what keeps a construct nested inside an earlier region
 * (inline code inside a fence, a link URL inside indented code) from being
 * protected twice and emitted twice by segment reconstruction.
 *
 * It lives here because the detectors are split across three modules for the
 * 300-line limit — markdownParser.ts, markdownParserInline.ts and
 * markdownParserBlocks.ts — and a predicate copied into each is a predicate
 * that can be fixed in one and left wrong in the others.
 *
 * It answers from a SNAPSHOT: the regions are sorted and merged once, and each
 * question is a binary search. Asking the growing list directly walked every
 * region per question, so a document with thousands of code spans or links
 * cost their number squared. A snapshot is enough because no detector needs
 * to see its own additions — its matches come in order and never overlap, so
 * a match cannot start inside an earlier match of the same pass.
 *
 * Half-open on purpose: `end` is exclusive, so a region ending at `pos` does
 * not contain it and the next construct may start exactly where the last one
 * finished.
 *
 * @coordinates-with markdownParser.ts — frontmatter, thematic breaks, fences
 * @coordinates-with markdownParserInline.ts — detectors 3-11
 * @coordinates-with markdownParserBlocks.ts — detectors 12-13
 * @coordinates-with formatterTables.ts — table lines inside a protected region
 * @module lib/cjkFormatter/protectedRegionSearch
