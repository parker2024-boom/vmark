/**
 * Paragraph breaks — the boundary no bracket or quote pairs across.
 *
 * Purpose: a formatted segment can hold several paragraphs (it runs from one
 * protected region to the next). Markdown ends a paragraph at a blank line,
 * so an opener before one is unclosed: `(一\n\n二)` is two paragraphs with a
 * stray paren each, and converting it to `（一\n\n二）` invents a pair the
 * author never wrote. Every pairing rule in the formatter applies its pairing
 * inside one paragraph at a time through these helpers.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - A blank line is one holding only spaces, tabs and blockquote markers
 *     (`>`), so a break inside a quote block (`> a\n>\n> b`) counts; CRLF line
 *     ends count the same as LF. A single newline is a soft break inside one
 *     paragraph and pairs as before.
 *   - The break text itself passes through untouched: the pairing rules only
 *     rewrite brackets and quotes, and a break holds neither.
 *
 * @coordinates-with rules/fullwidth.ts — parenthesis and bracket conversion
 * @coordinates-with rules/dashesQuotes.ts — guillemet, corner and nested-corner conversion
 * @coordinates-with quotePairing.ts — the stack-based quote pairing
 * @coordinates-with quoteToggle.ts — the pair the cursor sits in
