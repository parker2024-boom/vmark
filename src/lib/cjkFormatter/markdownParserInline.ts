/**
 * Inline Span Detectors for the Protected-Region Scanner
 *
 * Purpose: detectors 3 through 11 — the constructs that live INSIDE a line
 * rather than owning one. Inline code, images, link URLs, HTML tags, HTML
 * character references, wiki links, footnote definitions and references, and
 * both math forms.
 *
 * Split out of markdownParser.ts when adding the character-reference detector
 * (#1382) took that file past the 300-line limit. The seam mirrors the one
 * already there for markdownParserBlocks.ts: document scaffolding and fences
 * stay in the parent, line-oriented blocks are in Blocks, spans are here.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing and preserved exactly as it was: images before links
 * (or an image gets URL-only protection), footnote DEFINITIONS before
 * references (or `[^1]:` splits into a reference plus a stray colon), and
 * character references after HTML tags (so `&amp;` inside an attribute is
 * already claimed and cannot be split out of its tag). Each detector guards
 * its match START against the regions claimed before it, so a construct nested
 * in an earlier region is not double-protected.
 *
 * Cost is linear in the document. The bracketed constructs are found by the
 * scanners in inlineSpanScanners.ts rather than by `opener [^closer]* closer`
 * expressions, which reread the rest of the document from every opener once
 * the last closer is behind them. The three that remain expressions cannot do
 * that: a character reference is bounded in length, display math pairs each
 * `$$` with the next one, and inline math stops at the end of its line.
 *
 * Appends to `regions` IN PLACE, like detectLineOrientedRegions, because the
 * detectors are order-dependent and each reads what the previous ones claimed.
 *
 * @coordinates-with markdownParser.ts — calls this between the fence and block passes
 * @coordinates-with inlineSpanScanners.ts — the linear scanners for detectors 3-9
 * @coordinates-with characterReferences.ts — the shared reference pattern
 * @coordinates-with protectedRegionSearch.ts — the "already claimed" test
 * @module lib/cjkFormatter/markdownParserInline

  //     normalizeFullwidthPunctuation did, turning `&#x5176;实` into

  //     the span a segment edge, so it was eaten as trailing whitespace.

  //     itself, so this cannot drift away from what VMark renders.
