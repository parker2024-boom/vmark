/**
 * Markdown Protected Region Scanner
 *
 * Purpose: Identifies regions in markdown text that must be excluded from CJK
 * formatting. Without this, the formatter would corrupt code blocks, URLs,
 * math expressions, wiki links, and other structural markdown.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Detection order matters: fenced code blocks first, then inline code,
 *     then images (before links to avoid URL-only protection on images),
 *     then link URLs, HTML tags, character references, wiki links, footnotes,
 *     math, indented code
 *   - HTML CHARACTER REFERENCES are protected (#1382). A reference is
 *     punctuation wrapped around text, so any rule that rewrites punctuation
 *     can reach its terminating `;` — and the fullwidth rule did, turning
 *     `&#x5176;实` into `&#x5176；实`, which parses as literal text and is
 *     escaped on the next save. Reachable without the user typing an entity,
 *     because the WYSIWYG serializer emits one at a strong/emphasis delimiter
 *     boundary. See characterReferences.ts for why the match is shape-based
 *   - Frontmatter covers BOTH delimiters, `---` (YAML) and `+++` (TOML)
 *   - An UNCLOSED fence claims the rest of the document, as CommonMark says;
 *     a document being edited is unterminated most of the time
 *   - Each detector checks a region lookup before adding, so nested constructs
 *     (e.g., inline code inside a fenced block) are not double-protected
 *   - Link URLs protect only the URL part [text](URL), not the display text,
 *     so CJK in link text is still formatted
 *   - Footnote definitions are detected before references so [^1]: is not
 *     split into a reference + stray colon
 *   - Indented code detection skips list continuations by checking previous
 *     non-blank line for list markers
 *   - Thematic breaks (---) are protected to avoid dash-to-emdash conversion
 *   - Reference sections (## References, ## Further Reading) can be optionally
 *     skipped via skipReferenceSections option to protect bibliographic formatting
 *   - Overlapping or contained regions are coalesced before returning, so
 *     callers can rely on sorted, strictly non-overlapping regions
 *
 * @coordinates-with formatter.ts — calls findProtectedRegions before formatting
 * @coordinates-with fencedCode.ts — the fenced-code detector
 * @coordinates-with segments.ts — segment extraction/reconstruction over these regions
 * @coordinates-with rules.ts — formatting rules operate only on non-protected segments
 * @module lib/cjkFormatter/markdownParser
