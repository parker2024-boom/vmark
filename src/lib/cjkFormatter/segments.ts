/**
 * Formattable Segment Extraction and Reconstruction
 *
 * Purpose: Splits markdown text into formattable segments (the gaps between
 * protected regions) and reassembles the document after the segments have
 * been formatted. Split out of markdownParser.ts, which owns protected-region
 * detection.
 *
 * A segment also records what its edges ARE, because the rules cannot see
 * past them: whether each edge is a real line edge, and whether its first
 * character is the `)` closing a link whose URL is the protected region to
 * its left.
 *
 * Invariant: `protectedRegions` must be sorted by start and non-overlapping,
 * exactly as returned by `findProtectedRegions` (which coalesces overlapping
 * or contained regions). Overlapping regions would make reconstruction emit
 * the overlapped range twice.
 *
 * @coordinates-with markdownParser.ts — findProtectedRegions produces the regions
 * @coordinates-with formatter.ts — calls extract before and reconstruct after formatting
 * @module lib/cjkFormatter/segments
 */

/**
 * A text segment that should be formatted (a non-protected region).
 *
 * The two edge flags exist because the line-anchored rules — `removeTrailingSpaces`
 * (`/ +$/gm`) and `collapseSpaces` — run on a segment, not on the document, and
 * a segment boundary is NOT a line boundary. Without them, the space in
 * `使用 \`printf\` 函数` sat at the end of the segment `使用 ` and was deleted as
 * end-of-line trailing whitespace: a CJK/Latin spacer deleting CJK/Latin
 * spacing, on every inline code span, image, wiki link, footnote reference,
 * inline math span and HTML tag in the document.
