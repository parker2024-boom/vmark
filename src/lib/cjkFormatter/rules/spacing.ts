 * terminators, and the replacement drops the gap, so a number ending one

/**
 * Collapse multiple spaces to a single space, preserving indentation.

 *    end of line is markdown syntax. Collapsing it to one left
 *    `removeTrailingSpaces` — which would have PRESERVED a two-space run —
 *    looking at a single space, which it then deleted. So
 *    `preserveTwoSpaceHardBreaks` was inert under default settings and every
 *    hard line break in a CJK document was silently dropped, changing the
 *    rendered output. The lookaheads keep end-of-line runs intact: `(?! )`
 *    makes the run the WHOLE run, and the second then asks whether the line
 *    ends there. (Asking it of every shorter prefix, each time skipping the
 *    rest of the run, gave the same answer at the square of the cost.)
 *
 * 2. **Mistake a segment-leading run for indentation**. The
 *    `(\S)` prefix is how indentation is spared, but a segment that starts
 *    mid-line — because a protected region sits immediately to its left — has
 *    no `\S` to anchor against, so `` `code`   中文 `` kept all three spaces.
