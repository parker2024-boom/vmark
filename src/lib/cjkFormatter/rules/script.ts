/**
 * Which script a construct sits in, decided from its ADJACENT
 * characters.
 *
 * Purpose: a few rules have no single correct output across CJK. The ellipsis
 * is `……` in Chinese (GB/T 15834) and Japanese (JIS X 4051) but `…` in Korean
 * and `...` in Latin text, and only the Latin form takes a following space.
 *
 * Key decision — adjacency, not a document-level guess. `containsCJK` is
 * evaluated per SEGMENT, and a segment spans everything between two protected
 * regions, so "the document's script" is in practice the whole file's. A
 * document-level detector would rewrite the `...` inside an English quotation
 * in a Chinese file. Reading the immediate neighbours is local, needs no
 * detection pass, and is the same principle `normalizeFullwidthPunctuation`
 * uses to decide punctuation width.
 *
 * @coordinates-with universal.ts — normalizeEllipsis, the only consumer today
 * @coordinates-with shared.ts — the one definition of a CJK letter
 * @module lib/cjkFormatter/rules/script
