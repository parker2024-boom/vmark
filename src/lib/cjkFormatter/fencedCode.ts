/**
 * Fenced code blocks as protected regions.
 *
 * Purpose: the fenced-code detector of the protected-region scanner
 * (markdownParser.ts). The scan itself — one pass over the lines, a closer
 * at least as long as the opener's whole run, CRLF/LF/CR line endings — is
 * the shared scanner in `utils/markdownPipeline/fencedCodeBlocks.ts`; see its
 * header for the rules.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - An unclosed fence claims the rest of the document, as CommonMark says;
 *     a document being edited is unterminated most of the time, and the
 *     renderer shows that text as code, so the formatter must not rewrite it.
 *
 * @coordinates-with markdownParser.ts — the scanner that calls this first
 * @coordinates-with utils/markdownPipeline/fencedCodeBlocks.ts — the shared scan
 * @module lib/cjkFormatter/fencedCode
