/**
 * App bootstrap — the startup sequence `main.tsx` runs before first paint.
 *
 * Purpose: fill the secure-storage cache, bind the composition-root seams
 *   (tab-existence guard, plugin host settings, format registry) while that
 *   cache's IPCs are in flight, and only then load and mount App.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - App is loaded through `loadApp`, which `main.tsx` passes as
 *     `() => import("./App")`. The entry keeps the import site, so the App
 *     chunk and its modulepreload stay exactly as they were; the parameter
 *     exists because "App is loaded only after the cache is filled" is the
 *     contract, and a loader handed in is the one place that can be observed.
 *   - App → aiProviderStore → Zustand persist() hydrates at module evaluation
 *     time, so loading App before the cache is filled hydrates it empty.
 *
 * @coordinates-with main.tsx — the entry that calls it with the App loader
 * @module bootstrap
