/**
 * Stateful in-memory filesystem fake for the Tier-0 integration tier (WI-17).
 *
 * Purpose: let a test drive the REAL save / open / autosave / external-change
 * composition — real stores, real services — with `@tauri-apps/*` as the only
 * mocked boundary. Bytes written through the app's own write path come back
 * out of `readFile` (and, decoded, `readTextFile`), so an assertion can be
 * about the file, not about which function was called with what.
 *
 * Three contracts this fake exists to keep:
 *
 *   1. STATEFUL. `write(P, bytes)` → `read(P)` returns those bytes; mtime is
 *      settable and observable through `stat`. A choreography mock cannot
 *      distinguish "saved the right bytes" from "called the writer".
 *   2. NO SILENT SUCCESS. Every operation the fake does not model rejects (or
 *      throws, for a property access) with a message naming what was missing.
 *      `src/test/setup.ts` resolves `invoke` with `undefined` by default, so a
 *      flow that silently stopped writing still passed — the false-confidence
 *      class this tier exists to close. Reading an unknown path rejects like
 *      the real plugin does; an unstubbed command rejects by name.
 *   3. THE PLUGIN'S DECODING. Files are bytes. `readFile` returns them as
 *      they are; `readTextFile` decodes them as the plugin does, which DROPS a
 *      leading BOM. This fake used to hand `readTextFile` callers the BOM, and
 *      every jsdom BOM test passed on that difference while the real app lost
 *      the mark (statefulFsFake.plugin.test.ts pins the contract).
 *      Verified against the source of tauri-plugin-fs 2.x, the version
 *      `package.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` pin: the Rust commands
 *      `read_file` and `read_text_file` both call `read_file_inner`
 *      (`src/commands.rs`), which returns the file's raw bytes with no
 *      validation or BOM handling; in the guest JS (`guest-js/index.ts`),
 *      `readFile` returns those bytes as a `Uint8Array` and `readTextFile`
 *      returns `new TextDecoder(options?.encoding ?? 'utf-8').decode(bytes)`.
 *      Confirmed in the running app: `readFile` of a BOM'd file begins
 *      239, 187, 191 and `readTextFile` of it begins after them.
 *
 * Usage (the mock factory is lazy, so the dynamic import is safe):
 *
 *     vi.mock("@tauri-apps/plugin-fs", async () => {
 *       const { statefulFs } = await import("@/test/statefulFsFake");
 *       return statefulFs.fsModule();
 *     });
 *
 * @coordinates-with test/fakeDisk.ts — the in-memory disk this adapts to Tauri
 * @coordinates-with test/tier0/harness.ts — store reset + document seeding
 * @module test/statefulFsFake
