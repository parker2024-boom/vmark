/**
 * Tiptap content loads
 *
 * Purpose: replace the WYSIWYG editor's whole document with content that did
 * not come from the user's typing — the initial load and the store→editor
 * sync — without an undo step, and without the editor writing its
 * re-serialization back to the store as an edit.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - A load WAITS for an IME composition in progress (or just ended and not
 *     yet cleaned up) to settle (`writeWhenCompositionSettles`). A document
 *     replaced under the preedit text is committed or dropped by WebKit, and
 *     the composed text lands on top of the new document.
 *   - A waiting load is a function run later: it replaces the document as it
 *     is THEN, so text committed meanwhile cannot leave it with stale bounds.
 *   - A load that waited asks `stillWanted` before it runs. While it waited,
 *     the editor's own flush may have written what the user composed into the
 *     store, or a newer load may have been queued behind it; running it then
 *     would leave the editor showing a document the store no longer holds,
 *     with nothing left to sync them. A load applied at once is not asked.
 *   - The transaction carries `preventUpdate`: a load, not a user edit.
 *
 * @coordinates-with services/ime/compositionWriteGate.ts — the wait
 * @coordinates-with services/editor/unparseableDocument.ts — a refused sync lands in Source mode
 * @coordinates-with TiptapEditor.tsx — the initial load
 * @coordinates-with useTiptapContentSync.ts — the store→editor sync
 * @coordinates-with useTiptapFlush.ts — the flush that can supersede a waiting load
 * @module components/Editor/tiptapContentLoad
