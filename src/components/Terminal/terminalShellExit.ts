/**
 * terminalShellExit
 *
 * Purpose: What happens when a session's shell exits. Split out of
 * useTerminalShellLifecycle (file-size gate); the lifecycle still decides
 * WHETHER an exit counts (its spawn-generation guard), this decides what the
 * exit does.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Clean exit (code 0) closes the tab — and hides the panel when it was
 *     the last session (#1103). Non-zero exits keep the buffer open with a
 *     "press any key to restart" prompt so the failure stays readable.
 *   - EVERY exit is logged at warn level, which reaches the Tauri log in
 *     production. A clean exit tears the whole panel down with nothing left on
 *     screen to explain it, so without this line "the terminal closed by
 *     itself" is indistinguishable from a crash — and the log had nothing to
 *     say about it when that was reported.
 *   - A non-zero exit stops the dead program's pointer/focus reporting, and
 *     arms "press any key" only once that and the exit lines are PARSED
 *     (#1471). "Any key" is whatever reaches onData, and until then output the
 *     program had queued can still make xterm answer a query or report the
 *     mouse there — which would restart the shell and wipe the message.
 *
 * @coordinates-with useTerminalShellLifecycle.ts — sole caller (spawnPty onExit)
 * @coordinates-with terminalSessionReset.ts — stopUnsolicitedInput
 * @coordinates-with terminalMessages.ts — localized exit lines
