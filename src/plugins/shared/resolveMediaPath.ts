/**
 * Media Source Resolution
 *
 * Purpose: The one algorithm that turns a media `src` written in Markdown into
 * a URL the webview can load — for the inline image view, the Source-mode
 * preview and the block media node views alike.
 *
 * Pipeline: external URL -> returned verbatim; otherwise decode, then
 *   external URL (was bracketed/escaped) -> absolute path -> asset URL
 *   -> URI scheme -> refused -> unresolvable path -> caller's verdict
 *   -> relative path -> joined onto the document's directory -> asset URL
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Here, not in `utils/`, because it needs Tauri (`convertFileSrc`, the
 *     path API); `plugins/shared/` is importable by plugins and services both.
 *   - What differs between callers is a parameter, not a copy: where the
 *     document path comes from, and what an unresolvable path gets.
 *   - A source carrying a URI SCHEME is always refused (""). It is not inert:
 *     `file:` addresses the disk and a custom scheme addresses whatever this
 *     app registered, `vmark-trusted://` included.
 *     See src/test/adversarialMediaSources.ts.
 *   - A path nothing here can resolve (it names a directory, is home-relative,
 *     or is empty) is inert — the webview resolves it against the app origin,
 *     never `file://`. The inline resolvers hand it back unchanged; the block
 *     media resolver refuses it. Both are existing, tested behaviour.
 *   - A `..` segment is ordinary path syntax and is resolved (#1433).
 *   - A relative path with no document to resolve against, or whose resolution
 *     fails, comes back unchanged: merely unresolved, not hostile.
 *   - Do NOT percent-encode before `convertFileSrc`: it already encodes the
 *     whole path, and encoding here would double-encode (#752).
 *
 * @coordinates-with plugins/shared/mediaSecurity.ts — path classification
 * @coordinates-with plugins/shared/hostDocument.ts — the inline resolvers' document path
 * @coordinates-with services/media/resolveMediaSrc.ts — the block media resolver
 * @module plugins/shared/resolveMediaPath
