/**
 * Purpose: render inline LaTeX with KaTeX once per distinct source, then reuse
 * the result by cloning it.
 *
 * Inline math repeats heavily in real documents: in a 11,142-formula math
 * textbook only 4,440 sources were distinct (`$0$` alone appeared 605 times).
 * KaTeX parses and lays out every call from scratch; a deep clone of the tree
 * it already built is a fraction of that.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - The cache holds a DETACHED clone, never a live node, and every hit is
 *     cloned again, so no two node views ever share DOM.
 *   - Cloning, not `innerHTML`: KaTeX already produced the DOM, and reparsing a
 *     string of it would be both slower and a trusted-HTML sink.
 *   - Keyed by source alone. That is sound only while the render options are
 *     constant — no shared `macros` object, whose `\gdef`s would make the
 *     output depend on what rendered before. Adding one means keying on it.
 *   - Bounded LRU so a document with endless distinct formulas cannot grow it
 *     without limit.
 *
 * @coordinates-with plugins/latex/scheduleInlineMathRender.ts — the only caller
 * @module plugins/latex/inlineMathRenderCache
