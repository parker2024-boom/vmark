/**
 * Close a workspace instance from the rail.
 *
 * The rail shipped with no close affordance: the only way to remove a workspace
 * was to drag its icon outside the window, which is undiscoverable and easy to
 * trigger by accident, so instances accumulated with no way to clear them.
 *
 * `removeWorkspaceInstance` alone is NOT a close — it drops the instance from
 * the store while its tabs live on, orphaning them along with any unsaved work.
 * Closing therefore routes the workspace's tabs through the same
 * `closeTabsWithDirtyCheck` path the tab bar uses.
 *
 * CANCELLATION IS NOT ATOMIC, by design and by precedent. `closeTabsWithDirtyCheck`
 * closes tabs one at a time and stops at the first cancelled prompt, so
 * cancelling the third of five leaves two already closed and the workspace
 * still present. Nothing is lost silently — each closed tab got its own
 * save/discard prompt — and this is exactly how the tab bar's "Close Others"
 * already behaves, so close matches the app's existing semantics rather than
 * inventing a divergent two-phase protocol. What the cancel path DOES
 * guarantee is that the instance itself is not removed and the window is not
 * closed.
 *
 * PINNED TABS CLOSE WITH THEIR WORKSPACE. A pin protects a tab against an
 * accidental single close; closing the workspace is deliberate, and the rail
 * promises it closes the workspace's tabs. The close lifecycle refuses a
 * pinned tab and the bulk close stops at the first refusal, so passing pinned
 * ids through made one pinned tab turn Close into a silent "cancelled".
 * Unpinned tabs close first in one call; each pinned tab then closes on its
 * own with its pin lifted for that attempt and restored, in place, if its
 * save prompt is cancelled (services/tabs/closeLiftingPin).
 *
 * Ownership is resolved LIVE from the tab store via `tabBelongsToWorkspace`,
 * not from `instance.tabIds`. That field can be stale or shared: its own
 * docstring notes that trusting it "let two instances both collect the same
 * tab", which for a close would mean closing another workspace's tab or
 * orphaning one of our own.
 *
 * The post-removal invariants mirror `moveWorkspaceInstanceToNewWindow`:
 * `main` always keeps at least one instance (a placeholder), and a non-main
 * window that just lost its last workspace closes itself.
 *
 * @coordinates-with workspaceTabCollection.ts — shared ownership predicate
 * @coordinates-with workspaceWindowActions.ts — same invariants, move/duplicate
 * @coordinates-with services/tabs/closeLiftingPin.ts — closing pinned tabs
 * @module services/workspaces/closeWorkspaceInstance
