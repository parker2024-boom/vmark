/**
 * menuCommandsReady — the barrier the window-ready handshake waits on.
 *
 * Purpose: let `useWindowReady` announce "this window is listening" at the
 *   moment it becomes true, instead of guessing how long it takes.
 *
 * Why it exists: the handshake used to wait a fixed 100 ms. What it was
 *   waiting for is `useCommandBootstrap`, which `await`s a dynamic import
 *   (`registerPandocFormatCommands`) and only then mounts the single Tauri
 *   menu listener. A dynamic chunk fetch has no upper bound, so no constant
 *   could cover it — and when the constant expired first, Rust was told the
 *   window was ready and the next `menu:open` went to a listener that did not
 *   exist. The delay made that rare on a warm machine and did nothing at all
 *   on a cold or loaded one.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - One-shot and LEVEL-triggered, not edge-triggered: a waiter arriving
 *     after the signal resolves immediately. The two orderings are both real
 *     — the bootstrap effect can finish before the provider waits — and an
 *     edge-triggered latch would hang the handshake in one of them.
 *   - The wait is BUDGETED and resolves `false` rather than rejecting or
 *     hanging. A window that never announces itself is unusable; one that
 *     announces itself early is, at worst, the behaviour we already had.
 *   - The mount signals whether it succeeded, and the window announces itself
 *     either way. A mount that threw will never become mounted, and hanging
 *     the handshake on it would turn dead menus into a dead window — but the
 *     signal has to CARRY that. It used to fire from a
 *     `finally` with no payload, so a completely failed mount announced itself
 *     as ready and nothing downstream could tell the difference.
 *
 * @coordinates-with hooks/useCommandBootstrap.ts — signals after mountMenuCommands settles
 * @coordinates-with utils/readinessBarrier.ts — the barrier itself; the rules above are its rules
 * @coordinates-with contexts/useWindowReady.ts — waits before emitting `ready`
 * @module services/commands/menuCommandsReady
