/**
 * Window Close Flow
 *
 * Purpose: the whole-window close transaction — resolve every dirty document,
 * honour pins, run orphan cleanup, persist the session, and only then close
 * the native window. Extracted from useWindowClose so the hook is listener
 * wiring and this is testable orchestration.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Dirty AND divergent documents need resolution, same rule as the
 *     per-tab close.
 *   - The dirty set is REVALIDATED after EVERY await: save prompts, the
 *     pin dialog, and the cleanup/persist steps inside finalize all yield, and
 *     an edit (human or MCP) landing mid-await must produce another prompt,
 *     not a silent discard. Bounded — a document that cannot be brought to
 *     rest cancels the close. Two exemptions: a doc the user explicitly
 *     discarded (that choice covers whatever the buffer holds), and a doc
 *     whose buffer is byte-identical to a completed save (save-time
 *     normalization can leave isDirty standing with the bytes safely on disk).
 *   - NOTHING is destroyed until `close_window` is invoked. Cleanup and
 *     persistence read live stores; the store teardown runs after the native
 *     close call, so a rejected persist or close leaves the window fully
 *     intact instead of alive-but-empty. On success the webview dies and the
 *     teardown is moot.
 *   - The tab list for teardown is re-read at finalize time — tabs opened
 *     during a prompt are included instead of leaking.
 *   - One-pass dirty-context construction, in dirtyContexts.ts: there
 *     is no await between the filter and the map, so the old two-pass
 *     null-filter was dead code reachable only through a fabricated test.
 *
 * @coordinates-with useWindowClose.ts — sole caller (owns listeners + in-flight sharing)
 * @coordinates-with closeSave.ts — the prompts
 * @coordinates-with dirtyContexts.ts — which tabs still need saving, and the loop bound
 * @coordinates-with services/media/closeCleanup.ts — orphan cleanup before teardown
 * @module services/windowClose/windowCloseFlow
