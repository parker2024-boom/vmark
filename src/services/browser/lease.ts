/**
 * Browser automation lease — AI vs human arbitration (R11).
 *
 * Purpose: a single lease per browser tab deciding who drives the page — the AI
 * (a multi-step workflow run) or the human. WIRED: the workflow
 * runner acquires/releases it around a run, browser-chrome interaction and the
 * native page-input signal (`browser://user-input`) reclaim it for the human,
 * tab close clears it via `tabRemovalBus`, and the tab chrome renders the
 * "AI is controlling" state from `currentHolder`.
 *
 * The `epoch` is the TAKEOVER clock, and it moves ONLY on authority
 * transitions — reclaim and release — never on navigation. v1 of this module
 * bumped it on every navigation, which would have cancelled a workflow's own
 * `navigate to` steps (Codex review C3): per-page staleness is a DIFFERENT
 * clock, the driver's navigation generation, checked per act in Rust
 * (`authorize.rs`). One clock per question.
 *
 * Rules (all unit-tested):
 *   - Human input reclaims an AI-held lease immediately and unconditionally —
 *     the AI can only acquire a *free* tab. A human hold is the INTERRUPTION of an
 *     AI tenure, nothing more: reclaiming a tab the AI does not hold is a no-op, and
 *     the run service releases the hold (`release(tab, "human")`) when the
 *     interrupted run ends. Before audit 2026-09-03 W-04 a hold was permanent —
 *     nothing released it, so one accidental scroll refused every later
 *     `workflow_run` on that tab until it was closed.
 *   - A run's envelope carries `{holder, epoch}`. `validate` rejects it as
 *     `lease-lost` when the holder changed, `stale` when the epoch moved (the
 *     authority was reclaimed/released and re-granted since).
 *   - Every transition that ends the AI's authority — reclaim, release, tab
 *     close — cancels its in-flight step via the registered canceller, which
 *     fires at most once. A canceller may only be registered while the AI holds
 *     the lease, so a late registration cannot re-install an operation a
 *     reclaim just cancelled.
 *
 * The state arithmetic lives in `leaseTransitions.ts` as pure functions;
 * the state itself lives in `stores/browserLeaseStore.ts`, which holds data
 * only. This file owns SEQUENCING — record the new state first, run the canceller
 * after, outside any `set` — so it is the one writer of that store.
 *
 * @coordinates-with services/browser/leaseTransitions.ts — the pure transitions composed here
 * @coordinates-with stores/browserLeaseStore.ts — the state this service writes
 * @coordinates-with services/browser/browserLeaseWiring.ts — event sources (chrome, native input, tab close)
 * @coordinates-with components/Browser/BrowserChrome.tsx — renders the AI-control state
 * @module services/browser/lease
