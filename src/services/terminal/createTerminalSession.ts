/**
 * createTerminalSession — THE owner-aware creation service (audit 20260831
 * #17/#20).
 *
 * Purpose: every production creator of a terminal session goes through this
 * one function, so "resolve the owner, stamp the options" cannot drift
 * between call sites — the panel/init auto-create, the tab bar's +,
 * "Open Terminal Here", and Run-in-Terminal's reuse-or-create all did it by
 * hand before. `canCreateTerminalSessionHere` is the AUTHORITATIVE can-create
 * predicate: it computes the same creation-time union (D-T5) the store's cap
 * gate applies, owner included, so a UI gate can never say yes while creation
 * says no.
 *
 * @coordinates-with stores/terminalStore/sessionActions.ts — terminalCreateSession + creationUnion
 * @coordinates-with resolveTerminalOwnerInstanceId.ts — the D-T1 carve-outs
 * @module services/terminal/createTerminalSession
