/**
 * Whether a finished write may still update its document's path, tab path and
 * saved snapshots.
 *
 * Two ways to qualify, and BOTH are needed:
 *
 *   - **It is the newest save submitted for this document.** This is what lets
 *     a Save As re-point the document at all, and what makes the user's most
 *     recent choice win between two Save As operations whatever order their
 *     writes finish in.
 *   - **Its path is still where the document lives.** Two ordinary saves to one
 *     file are serialized by path and both legitimately record their snapshot;
 *     the older is not "superseded" in any way that matters, and withholding it
 *     would leave the document dirty against bytes already on disk.
 *
 * What fails both is exactly the defect: an autosave to `/repo/old.md` that
 * lands after a Save As to `/repo/new.md`. It is not the newest save, and
 * `/repo/old.md` is no longer the document — so it must not reset the document
 * and tab back to the file the user just moved away from.
 *
 * An untitled document (no live path) matches nothing, so only its newest save
 * may name it.
