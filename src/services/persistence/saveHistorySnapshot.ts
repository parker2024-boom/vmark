/**
 * Purpose: record a version-history snapshot for a save, and warn the user
 * exactly once per session when the history backend is broken.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - A snapshot failure never fails the save. The file is already on disk;
 *     refusing the save afterwards would be a lie about what happened.
 *   - But it is not silent either. A broken history directory (permissions
 *     changed, disk full) otherwise looks exactly like history working, and
 *     the user finds out when they need a version that was never taken. The
 *     first failure per session warns; the rest stay quiet so a persistently
 *     broken backend does not spam a toast on every keystroke's autosave.
 *   - Awaited by `saveToPath`, deliberately: close flows need best-effort
 *     completion before the window goes.
 *   - An MCP write is filed as its own kind, `mcp`, so history shows which
 *     versions an AI client wrote. Only `auto` snapshots are merged into their
 *     predecessor or skipped above the size limit, so an `mcp` snapshot is
 *     kept exactly as a manual one is.
 *
 * @coordinates-with services/persistence/saveToPath.ts — the caller
 * @coordinates-with services/history/historyOperations.ts — createSnapshot
 * @module services/persistence/saveHistorySnapshot
