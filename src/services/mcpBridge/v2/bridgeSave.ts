/**
 * Purpose: the ONE way an MCP bridge handler puts a document on disk.
 *
 * `document.write`, `workspace.save` and `workspace.save_as` used to call
 * plugin-fs `writeTextFile` themselves. Writing around the app's save pipeline
 * meant an AI client's write lost the file's line endings and byte-order mark,
 * was not ordered against other saves of the same file (last write wins), could
 * be re-pointed to the old path by a late autosave after a Save As, took no
 * history snapshot, and was not atomic. This module hands the write to
 * `saveToPathForMcp` — the same pipeline a human save runs — and renders a
 * failure as a reason the handler can report to the client.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - The path guard runs HERE, in front of the pipeline, on every call. A
 *     handler cannot reach the disk without it, whatever it checked earlier;
 *     `save_as` checks first as well because its overwrite probe needs the
 *     verdict before it may touch the path at all.
 *   - The caller passes the content. Each handler captures the buffer at the
 *     moment its write is defined, before any await; reading the store here,
 *     after the guard's round trip, would save whatever a later request put
 *     there under this request's name.
 *   - Failure messages are plain English for an AI client, not localized UI
 *     copy: the pipeline shows the human nothing for an MCP save, so this
 *     text is the whole report.
 *   - A rejected write keeps its raw rejection (`cause`). The handlers that
 *     answer a failed save with an error reply rethrow it, so `wrapHandler`
 *     renders a typed error with its token exactly as for any other command.
 *
 * @coordinates-with services/persistence/saveToPath.ts — saveToPathForMcp, the pipeline
 * @coordinates-with services/persistence/saveOutcome.ts — the failure being rendered
 * @coordinates-with services/mcpBridge/bridgePathGuard.ts — checkBridgePath
 * @coordinates-with __tests__/bridgeWriteInvariant.test.ts — holds this as the only door
 * @module services/mcpBridge/v2/bridgeSave
