/**
 * Purpose: `vmark.session.get_state` — one-shot orientation for AI agents.
 *   Replaces five legacy discovery tools (get_capabilities,
 *   get_document_revision, tabs.list, workspace.get_focused,
 *   workspace.list_windows) with a single call that returns every window,
 *   every tab, and per-tab metadata including a revision token.
 *
 * Origin: MCP pruning plan (retired) ADR-6.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - The per-tab and per-window serialization, the human-tab privacy rule and
 *     the protocol gate live in `sessionSerializers.ts`; this
 *     module composes them into the payload and answers the request.
 *   - `focused` comes from the PLATFORM, not from this webview's own label.
 *     The bridge routes a request to whichever window owns the workspace, so
 *     the responding window is frequently not the one the user is looking at.
 *   - Browser tabs are gated on the protocol the client declares (`clientProtocol`
 *     on the get_state request) and withheld from clients older than 0.3.0 —
 *     including any request that omits the field, which is how a pre-0.3 sidecar
 *     presents itself. The bundled sidecar is version-locked in shipped builds,
 *     so this only matters under version skew (a stale or swapped local sidecar);
 *     the gate closes that case rather than relying on the bundling alone.
 *   - The request handler flushes the mounted editors before the state is
 *     built. Each tab's `dirty` flag and kind are read from the store, which
 *     trails the editor by a debounce; without the flush a tab the user is
 *     typing in is reported clean.
 *
 * @coordinates-with services/mcpBridge/v2/sessionSerializers.ts — tab + window records
 * @coordinates-with services/mcpBridge/v2/liveEditor.ts — the flush
 * @coordinates-with services/mcpBridge/v2/readOperationArgs.ts — the one payload parse
 * @coordinates-with stores/tabStore.ts — the windows to enumerate
 * @coordinates-with services/mcpBridge/focusedWindow.ts — real focused window
 * @module services/mcpBridge/v2/session
