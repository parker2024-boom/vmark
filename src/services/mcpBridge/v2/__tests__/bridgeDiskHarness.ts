/**
 * Shared setup for the bridge suites whose claim is about BYTES ON DISK.
 *
 * These suites run the real handler over the real stores and the real save
 * pipeline; `@tauri-apps/*` is the only mocked boundary, behind the stateful
 * disk fake. A handler test that mocks the writer can only say "the writer was
 * called" — which is how three bridge handlers kept writing around the save
 * pipeline with every test green.
 *
 * Each suite wires the two mock factories itself (vi.mock is hoisted per file),
 * from `bridgeWriteGate.ts` — NOT from this module, which imports the app and
 * therefore the very modules being mocked:
 *
 *     vi.mock("@tauri-apps/plugin-fs", async () =>
 *       (await import("./bridgeWriteGate")).gatedFsModule());
 *     vi.mock("@tauri-apps/api/core", async () =>
 *       (await import("./bridgeWriteGate")).gatedCoreModule());
 *
 * @coordinates-with bridgeWriteGate.ts — the mocked Tauri surface and the write gate
 * @coordinates-with test/statefulFsFake.ts — the disk
 * @coordinates-with test/tier0/harness.ts — store reset and the real open flow
 * @module services/mcpBridge/v2/__tests__/bridgeDiskHarness
