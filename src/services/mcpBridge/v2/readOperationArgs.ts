/**
 * Purpose: ONE typed parse of an MCP wire payload, from the generated
 *   contract — replacing the per-field `typeof` chains each handler carried
 *   Every chain was a hand-written restatement of a contract that
 *   lives elsewhere, which is how `args.clientId` survived: a read for a field
 *   the contract never declared, that no sender could ever populate, sitting
 *   behind a fallback that was the only branch that ever ran.
 *
 * Coercion is deliberately the SAME as the chains it replaces: a declared
 * field whose runtime value is the wrong shape reads as absent, and the
 * handler's own guard decides what that means. This is a de-duplication, not
 * a tightening — a stricter payload gate belongs with a protocol change.
 * `readOperationArgsChecked` also names those fields, for the handlers whose
 * guard must refuse them rather than treat them as absent (the browser
 * surface's tab id, timeouts, style operations, workflow inputs).
 *
 * Undeclared fields are LOGGED, never silently dropped (ledger D5): the app
 * side cannot refuse them without breaking version skew in the direction skew
 * actually happens (newer sidecar, older app), but a field arriving that
 * nothing declares is exactly the signal a dead branch is being fed.
 *
 * @coordinates-with generated/bridgeContracts.ts — the generated contract
 * @module services/mcpBridge/v2/readOperationArgs
