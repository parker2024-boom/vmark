/**
 * Purpose: land a document the WYSIWYG parser refuses in Source mode, and tell
 * the user why, instead of leaving them a blank rich-text editor (#1407).
 *
 * The editor used to catch the failure, log it to the console — nowhere a user
 * looks — and carry on with an EMPTY document. That editor was live: the first
 * keystroke flushed the empty document to the store, so typing would have
 * saved over the file the user had just opened. The nesting guard
 * (#1374) refuses documents past `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` by design, so this path is
 * reachable from any sufficiently deep file.
 *
 * Source mode shows the text as it is and needs no parse, so it is the one
 * place such a document is both visible and safely editable. The per-tab
 * forced-Source marker already exists for large files; it carries the reason,
 * so the status bar can say the true one.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - ONE report per tab. A split view parses the same document in more than
 *     one editor; the marker doubles as the "already told them" flag.
 *   - A tab already in Source mode gets no toast — the user is looking at it —
 *     but a SIZE reason becomes the refusal, because the reason is what stops
 *     writes (below).
 *   - Any parse failure, not only the nesting refusal. A blank editor that can
 *     overwrite the file is the same hazard whatever the cause; the nesting
 *     refusal just gets the more specific message.
 *   - The marker is also what stops the refused editor WRITING: its content is
 *     empty or stale, so `useTiptapFlush` drops every flush for the tab while
 *     it carries the `unparseable` reason — the pending keystroke, Save, and
 *     the unmount flush that runs as the tab switches to Source mode.
 *
