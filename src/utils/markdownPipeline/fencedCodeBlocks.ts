/**
 * Fenced code blocks, found in one pass over the lines.
 *
 * Purpose: the one fenced-code scanner for code that must find fences in raw
 * markdown text without parsing it — the CJK formatter's protected regions
 * and the serializer cosmetic pass's code ranges. A fence is up to three
 * spaces of indentation and a run of three or more backticks or tildes; it
 * closes on a line holding, after up to three spaces, a run of the SAME
 * character at least as long as the opener's WHOLE run, and nothing else but
 * spaces and tabs.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - One pass, line by line: outside a fence a line may open one, inside a
 *     fence a line may only close it. A pairing PATTERN retried every opener
 *     that had no closer against the whole rest of the document — quadratic
 *     on a document of openers that cannot close one another ("```a").
 *   - The opener's run is the whole run. A pattern let it shrink by
 *     backtracking, so six backticks read as a three-backtick fence with
 *     "```" as its info string and a three-backtick line closed it — which
 *     CommonMark forbids.
 *   - An unclosed fence runs to the end of the document, as CommonMark says,
 *     and is reported with `closed: false`; each caller decides what that
 *     means for it. That includes an opener on the last line with no newline
 *     after it.
 *   - Lines end at CRLF, LF or a lone CR, as a multiline pattern's `^`/`$`
 *     read them, so a CRLF document's fences open and close as an LF one's.
 *   - Container prefixes (`>` of a blockquote, list indentation past three
 *     spaces) are not understood: this is a text scan, not a parse.
