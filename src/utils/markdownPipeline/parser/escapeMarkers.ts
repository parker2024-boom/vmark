/**
 * Pre/post processors for VMark's custom escape markers.
 *
 * Purpose: users write `\==`, `\++`, `\^`, `\~` to produce literal characters.
 * remark resolves backslash escapes before VMark's inline-mark plugin runs, so
 * by then `\==` and `==` are the same text. The sequences are therefore
 * swapped for Unicode Private Use Area placeholders before parsing — inert to
 * every tokenizer — and swapped back once the marks have been read.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Every sequence is replaced, wherever it stands; WHERE an escape applies
 *     is decided afterwards, from the node the placeholder ended up in. The
 *     parser already knows what is code, math, HTML, a link destination or a
 *     paragraph. A scanner run over the source beforehand has to guess, and
 *     guessed wrong: one stray backtick was taken for the start of a code span
 *     that never closed, switching escapes off for the rest of the document,
 *     while indented code, math, HTML, frontmatter and link destinations were
 *     not recognised at all and kept the placeholder — a private-use character
 *     written into the user's file.
 *   - Where the parser reads no escapes — code, math, HTML, frontmatter, an
 *     autolink's address, a reference's identifier — the placeholder goes back
 *     to the sequence as written (`\==`). Everywhere else it becomes the
 *     literal marker (`==`), which is what the escape means.
 *   - Two passes, because transforms run between them. Raw nodes are restored
 *     straight after parsing: a later transform may turn one into text (math
 *     that fails validation), and that text must already hold the source.
 *     HTML waits for the second pass: a `<details>` block is HTML that is
 *     parsed again as markdown, and its text needs the placeholders until the
 *     inline marks inside it have been read.
 *   - The source scan honours backslash pairing: in `\\==` the backslashes
 *     escape each other and the marker is real.
 *
 * @coordinates-with ../parser.ts — runs the three steps around the parse
 * @coordinates-with ../inlineParser.ts — the same steps for a details summary
 * @coordinates-with ../plugins/customInline.ts — the marks the placeholders hide from
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/parser/escapeMarkers
