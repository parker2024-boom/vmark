/**
 * Purpose: serialize a `details` MDAST node back to HTML — the mdast→markdown
 * direction of `detailsBlock`.
 *
 * Split from the parser when the file crossed 300 lines. Parsing HTML into a
 * node and writing a node back out are opposite directions with no shared
 * state; keeping them together meant every change to one re-read the other.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - A summary is read as inline markdown, so it is WRITTEN as inline
 *     markdown: when the node carries its summary as nodes
 *     (`summaryChildren`, set for a block that comes from the editor) they
 *     are serialized like any other inline content — marks, escapes and all.
 *     Writing only the summary's text turned `**bold**` into `bold`.
 *   - Inside the summary a `<` in TEXT is written `&lt;`, so authored text
 *     can never close the tag early or become markup (serializerText.ts does
 *     this while the `detailsSummary` construct is open). Nothing else is
 *     HTML-escaped: the reader decodes a character reference once, so one
 *     written for a quote or an ampersand that did not need it would be a
 *     rewrite of the author's text.
 *   - A node with only a `summary` string — a tree that did not come from the
 *     editor — is written with that string HTML-escaped, as before.
 *
 * @coordinates-with detailsBlock.ts — registers this as a toMarkdown extension
 * @coordinates-with ../pmDetailsConverter.ts — supplies `summaryChildren`
 * @coordinates-with ../serializerText.ts — escapes `<` in summary text
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/plugins/detailsSerializer
