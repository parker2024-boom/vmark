/**
 * Hard-break serialization — the `break` handler.
 *
 * Purpose: write a hard break in the document's chosen spelling (`\` or two
 * trailing spaces) at the one place that knows it is writing a hard break.
 *
 * The style cannot be applied to the finished string instead. A backslash
 * that ends a line of text is a hard break, a LaTeX row separator in `$$`
 * math, a line of an HTML block, an attribute value spanning two lines, or a
 * literal backslash before a soft break — and the string does not say which.
 * Rewriting it by pattern corrupts every one of those but the first. Here only
 * `break` nodes are written, so nothing else can be.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - "May a line ending appear here?" is asked of upstream, through
 *     `state.safe`, rather than re-derived: a table cell answers no, and the
 *     break degrades to a space exactly as upstream's own handler does.
 *     `serializerBreak.test.ts` holds the backslash style to stock
 *     remark-stringify's output for every construct a break can sit in.
 *   - One more place takes no line ending: directly before inline HTML that
 *     would start an HTML block on a line of its own. Upstream replaces the
 *     line ending there with a space AFTER this handler has run, which turns a
 *     backslash break into a literal backslash and a space. So the break is
 *     written as the space itself. (HTML that may start a line is handled in
 *     serializerBreakBeforeHtml.ts, and the break before it is kept.)
 *   - Two trailing spaces say "hard break" only directly after a
 *     non-whitespace character that leaves them alone. Where they cannot say
 *     it, the break is written with a backslash whatever the style
 *     (`mustBeBackslash`):
 *       · first in its parent, or right after another break — spaces alone on
 *         a line make a BLANK line; the paragraph splits and the break is gone;
 *       · after text that ends in a space or tab — the spaces join that run
 *         and are read back as part of the break, so the text loses its own
 *         whitespace, and after a tab no break is read back at all;
 *       · after emphasis, strong or strikethrough whose text ends in
 *         whitespace — that delimiter then has whitespace on both sides, and
 *         its handler has both written as character references
 *         (serializerAttention.ts, `encodeSides`); `&#x20;` plus one space is
 *         not a hard break. `*italic \` continued on the next line is ordinary
 *         writing;
 *       · after an inline tag that opens its paragraph — a line holding one
 *         complete tag and then only whitespace starts an HTML block.
 *   - `peek` tells the truth. It is the first character the node BEFORE the
 *     break is told to expect, and that node decides its own escaping by it:
 *     `1.` or `-` is text only while something other than whitespace follows,
 *     and must escape itself before a two-space break. So the rule above is
 *     decided from the tree — the break's place among its siblings — which
 *     `peek` can see as well as the handler can, and the two share it.
 *     Answering a backslash always, or a space always, each loses breaks: the
 *     first turns `1.` into an empty list item, the second is the emphasis
 *     case.
 *   - The handler also refuses two spaces when the output so far ends in
 *     whitespace or is empty, whatever the tree says. That is the one place it
 *     can differ from `peek`, and only for a sibling shape the rule does not
 *     know: a backslash is then written where a space was announced, to a
 *     neighbour whose output ended in whitespace.
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — installs this handler, one processor per style
 * @coordinates-with serializerAttention.ts — the delimiters that encode their neighbours
 * @coordinates-with serializerBreakBeforeHtml.ts — keeps the line ending before inline HTML
 * @coordinates-with serializerText.ts — text line endings, the sibling concern
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/serializerBreak
