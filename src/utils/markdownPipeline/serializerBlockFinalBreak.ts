/**
 * A hard break at the end of its block — dropped before serializing.
 *
 * Purpose: markdown cannot write a hard break as the last thing in a
 * paragraph, heading or table cell. A backslash there is a literal backslash,
 * so the text gained one on reload; two trailing spaces are simply dropped;
 * and a heading that contains a break is written in setext form, whose
 * underline is as long as the heading's last line — which, after a final
 * break, is empty, so the heading came back as a paragraph.
 *
 * The editor can hold such a break (Shift+Enter at the end of a block). It
 * shows as nothing once the block ends, and CommonMark reads none there, so
 * the faithful output is the block without it.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Done on the TREE, before stringifying, not in the `break` handler:
 *     upstream chooses a heading's form by whether the node holds a break, so
 *     the break has to be gone before that choice is made.
 *   - Only the trailing run of breaks goes, and only where the parent is the
 *     block itself. A break that ends an emphasis run in the middle of a
 *     paragraph is not at the end of anything.
 *   - The tree handed in is not changed.
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — runs this before stringifying
 * @coordinates-with serializerBreak.ts — writes the breaks that remain
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/serializerBlockFinalBreak
