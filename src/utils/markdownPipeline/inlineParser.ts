/**
 * Inline Markdown Parser
 *
 * Purpose: Parses inline markdown text to MDAST inline content nodes,
 * used for contexts where only inline (phrasing) content is expected.
 *
 * Pipeline: inline markdown string → unified/remark → extract paragraph children
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Fast-path check for text without markdown chars avoids remark overhead
 *   - Falls back to plain text node on parse failure for resilience
 *   - One processor, built on first use: the dialect's plugin set is fixed
 *
 * @coordinates-with plugins/detailsBlock.ts — parses <summary> text with inline formatting
 * @coordinates-with parser/escapeMarkers.ts — escaped custom markers, as in the document parse
 * @coordinates-with mdastToProseMirror.ts — consumers convert resulting MDAST to PM nodes
 * The processor comes from the shared `inline-summary` dialect, so
 * this parser cannot drift from the others on what `~x~` or `==x==` mean.
 *
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/inlineParser

 * tag, and what an autolink is made of.
 *
 * `&`, `\` and `<` belong here as much as the delimiters do. Without them a
 * summary written `a &lt; b` was taken as that literal text, and escaped once
