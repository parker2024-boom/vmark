/**
 * Attention delimiters — `*emphasis*`, `**strong**` and `~~strikethrough~~`.
 *
 * Purpose: emit every attention delimiter where VMark's parser (micromark) will
 * read it back as the same mark. One module owns all three because they share
 * one rule set: a run of `*`, `_` or `~` opens or closes depending only on the
 * characters on either side of the RUN, so a decision made for one mark is
 * wrong whenever a neighbour changes what those characters are.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Flanking is fixed the way mdast-util-to-markdown fixes it: a character
 *     beside a delimiter that stops it flanking is written as a character
 *     reference, which is punctuation to the parser and decodes back to the
 *     same text. The decision table (`encodeSides`) is upstream's `encodeInfo`.
 *   - Characters are classified exactly as micromark does (`classify`): Unicode
 *     P and S categories count as punctuation, per UTF-16 code unit. The old
 *     `delete` handler tested ASCII punctuation only, so `文字~~。word~~` came
 *     back as literal tildes.
 *   - Emphasis beside a `strong` sibling is written with `_`. Flush `*`
 *     delimiters merge into one run — `**a***b*` — whose flanking is decided by
 *     characters neither node looked at, and italic typed next to bold was lost
 *     on save (found by the #1407 soak). `_` and `*` never merge.
 *     Everywhere else emphasis stays `*`, the house style; a parent/child edge
 *     such as `***x***` is fine as it is and keeps its spelling.
 *   - A character reference always covers a whole CODE POINT. Encoding one half
 *     of a surrogate pair destroys the character.
 *
 * Why these are VMark's handlers rather than upstream's: upstream's emphasis
 * marker is one global option, and `delete` (mdast-util-gfm-strikethrough) does
 * no flanking at all. Neighbour encoding itself still happens in upstream's
 * `containerPhrasing`, driven by `attentionEncodeSurroundingInfo`, which VMark
 * patches to encode whole code points too (patches/mdast-util-to-markdown).
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — installs these handlers
 * @coordinates-with markEdgeWhitespace.ts — moves edge whitespace out of `~~`,
 *   which cannot close after a space
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/serializerAttention
