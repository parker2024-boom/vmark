/**
 * A line ending directly before inline HTML — keeping it.
 *
 * Purpose: mdast-util-to-markdown replaces a line ending that comes directly
 * before an inline `html` node with a space, because a tag at the start of a
 * line may be read as the start of an HTML BLOCK. After a hard break that
 * leaves `\ ` — a literal backslash and a space — or three spaces: the break
 * is gone, and in the backslash spelling a backslash has been added to the
 * text. `text\` followed by `<kbd>…` on the next line is ordinary writing.
 * After a soft line ending the author's line break becomes a space, and a
 * literal backslash before it is escaped on that save and not on the next.
 *
 * Most tags cannot do what upstream guards against: only some HTML starts a
 * block that may interrupt a paragraph (`<div>`, `<pre>`, a comment), and
 * `<b>`, `<span>`, `<kbd>` do not. For those the line ending is safe, and the
 * break can be kept.
 *
 * How: upstream decides by node TYPE. Before serializing, an `html` node that
 * follows a line ending — a `break`, or text that ends in one — and may
 * safely start a line is given another type, with a handler that writes the
 * same text. Upstream then leaves the line ending alone.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - "May this start a line inside a paragraph?" is asked of the parser, on a
 *     three-token probe (`x`, a break, the HTML), not answered from a list of
 *     tag names: the list is CommonMark's seven HTML-block start conditions,
 *     and a copy of it here would be a second definition free to drift.
 *     Answers are cached by the HTML text; the cache is small and bounded.
 *   - The tree handed in is not changed. Only the nodes on the way to a
 *     retyped one are copied.
 *   - HTML that WOULD start a block keeps its type. The break before it
 *     cannot be written at all, and serializerBreak.ts writes a space there
 *     instead of a spelling that would add a backslash.
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — runs the pass and installs the handler
 * @coordinates-with serializerBreak.ts — the break's side of the same boundary
 * @coordinates-with parser.ts — the probe
