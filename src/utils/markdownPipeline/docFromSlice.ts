/**
 * A ProseMirror slice as a document, and as markdown.
 *
 * Purpose: the one way a SELECTION is turned into markdown. Copy-as-markdown
 * (plugins/markdownCopy) and Source Peek (services/editor/sourcePeek) both
 * need it, and each kept its own copy of these helpers. The copies drifted:
 * the copy path stopped passing the document's hard-break style and then
 * post-processed the result in ways that changed its meaning.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Pure, and settings arrive as arguments. Plugins may not reach the
 *     app's services or stores, and utilities may not either, so the caller
 *     resolves the options and passes them in.
 *   - The output is the serializer's output, unchanged. Everything it
 *     escapes, it escapes because the text would read back as something else
 *     without it; anything it could safely leave unescaped it already has
 *     (serializerCosmetics.ts). A caller that strips more changes what is
 *     pasted.
 *
