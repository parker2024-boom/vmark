/**
 * A heading whose only line endings are inside inline code or math — those
 * flattened before serializing.
 *
 * Purpose: upstream chooses a heading's form from the tree: setext when any
 * node inside it holds a line ending, ATX otherwise. The inline code and
 * inline math handlers then write a line ending as a space wherever the next
 * character could start a block, so such a heading came out in setext form
 * with its content on one line; read back, the content held no line ending,
 * and the next save wrote it ATX. One heading, two spellings on consecutive
 * saves.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Done on the TREE, before stringifying: the form is chosen from the tree.
 *   - A line ending inside a code span renders as a space (CommonMark §6.1),
 *     and TeX reads one as whitespace, so writing it as a space changes no
 *     rendered heading.
 *   - Only when nothing else in the heading needs a second line: a text or
 *     HTML node with a line ending, or a hard break, is written as a line
 *     ending, and the heading stays setext with its spans untouched.
 *   - Only setext-eligible headings (depth 1 and 2); deeper ones are ATX
 *     whatever they hold.
 *   - The tree handed in is not changed.
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — runs this before stringifying
 * @coordinates-with serializerBlockFinalBreak.ts — the other pass that settles a heading's form
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/serializerHeadingForm
