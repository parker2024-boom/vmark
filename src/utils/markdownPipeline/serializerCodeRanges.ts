/**
 * Serialized-markdown code ranges — where the cosmetic pass does not look for
 * escapes to strip.
 *
 * Purpose: the cosmetic pass edits the string remark-stringify produced, and
 * skips fenced code blocks and inline code spans when collecting candidates.
 * This module answers "is this offset inside code?" for it, from one sorted
 * range list.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Fences come from the one-pass scanner (fencedCodeBlocks.ts), which costs
 *     linear time on any input and closes a fence only on a run at least as
 *     long as its opener's. A pairing pattern was quadratic on a document of
 *     openers that never close. Only CLOSED fences are ranges: the serializer
 *     always closes the fences it writes, so an unclosed opener line sits in
 *     raw HTML or math, and its text must stay a candidate.
 *   - These ranges are an approximation of code, and are safe ONLY as a
 *     candidate filter: the cosmetic pass accepts its edits solely when the
 *     result re-parses to the same tree, so a range this misses costs a
 *     rejected edit, never a changed document. Nothing may apply an edit on
 *     the strength of these ranges alone: they do not cover math, HTML,
 *     tables or indented code. That is why the hard-break spelling is chosen
 *     on the `break` node (serializerBreak.ts) and not by a pass that
 *     consults them.
 *
 * Split out of `serializerCosmetics.ts` to keep it within its size budget.
 *
