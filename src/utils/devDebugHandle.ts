/**
 * DEV-only `window.__VMARK_DEBUG__` publication.
 *
 * Purpose: give the E2E harness a way to reach the app that does not exist
 * otherwise. The debug automation bridge exposes only `list_windows`,
 * `execute_js` and `capture_native_screenshot`; a Tauri event emitted from inside
 * the webview never reaches the app's own `listen()` handlers (confirmed with a
 * non-browser control event), and synthetic keyboard events do not reach the
 * keybinding layer. `execute_js` is therefore the only channel, and it can only
 * call what the app has put on `window`.
 *
 * MERGE, NEVER REPLACE. There is more than one publisher (the editor view, the
 * command runner), and the original code assigned the whole object. A second
 * publisher would then erase the first — and because the editor view republishes
 * on every editor change, the erasure would be intermittent and would read as a
 * flaky harness rather than a bug here.
 *
 * DEV-GATED, deliberately. Shipping this would let any script running in the app
 * webview invoke arbitrary commands. `import.meta.env.DEV` is statically replaced
 * at build time, so the branch — and everything it reaches — is dropped from a
 * production bundle rather than merely being unused.
 *
 * A few older handles live as their own top-level globals rather than inside
 * `__VMARK_DEBUG__` (E2E journeys and DevTools recipes read them by those
 * names). `publishDevGlobal` gives them the same DEV gate, and the closed
 * `DevGlobalName` union is the inventory of every such name.
 *
