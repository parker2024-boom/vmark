/**
 * Media Extensions — single source of truth
 *
 * Purpose: One canonical list per media kind (image/video/audio). Previously
 * these lists were redefined in 7+ places with DIVERGENT contents — `avif`,
 * `bmp`, and `ico` disagreed across copies, so detection paths disagreed on
 * whether the same file was an image (a latent correctness bug, not just DRY).
 *
 * Two forms are exported because callers need both:
 * - bare (`png`)   — Tauri file-dialog `extensions` filters expect no dot.
 * - dotted (`.png`) — path/URL suffix detection matches the trailing extension.
 *
 * The canonical IMAGE set is the UNION of all former copies (the most permissive
 * is the intended set: a real image file should be recognized everywhere).
 *
 * @coordinates-with src/utils/mediaExtensions.json — the data, shared with Rust
 * @coordinates-with src-tauri/src/asset_access.rs — embeds the same file for the asset:// grant gate
 * @module utils/mediaExtensions
 */

/**
 * The lists themselves live in `mediaExtensions.json`, the ONE file both this
 * module and the Rust asset-protocol gate (`src-tauri/src/asset_access.rs`,
 * via `include_str!`) read. They used to be two hand-kept copies held together
 * by a Rust test that parsed this file's source text, so a comment or a
 * reformat could break or fool the check. Both sides now validate the same
 * data: lowercase bare extensions, none named twice.
 *
 * Image: the canonical union of the former copies, broadened for the media
 * viewer. macOS WKWebView decodes heic/heif/tiff natively; where a webview
 * can't decode a format the media viewer degrades to an "open externally"
 * fallback rather than erroring.
