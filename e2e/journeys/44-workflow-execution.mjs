/**
 * Journey: workflow-execution
 *
 * Journey 13 opens a workflow YAML and stops at the split pane. This one RUNS
 * one: an engine workflow (website/guide/workflows.md — top-level `steps:`
 * using `action/*`) opened from a workspace, started with the panel's real Run
 * button, executed by the Rust runner, and checked two ways — the step
 * statuses the panel paints, and the file the workflow wrote, read back FROM
 * DISK in this Node process. The jsdom tier
 * (src/test/tier0/workflowRun.test.tsx) pins the frontend half with `invoke`
 * and the runner's events faked; nothing there executes a step.
 *
 * THE WORKFLOW needs no AI provider and no network — `action/*` steps only
 * (src-tauri/src/workflow/actions.rs; `provider` is optional for them,
 * commands.rs `run_workflow`):
 *
 *     read    action/read-file   input.md                       → outputs.text
 *     notify  action/notify      a message
 *     write   action/save-file   out/result.md ← ${{ steps.read.outputs.text }}
 *
 * So the bytes of `out/result.md` are the bytes of `input.md` (CJK, a `${HOME}`
 * that must NOT be expanded — expressions.rs scans the template once — and a
 * trailing newline), carried through the runner's step outputs and written by
 * the sandboxed, atomic writer into a directory the step had to create.
 *
 * WHAT HAS TO BE TRUE FIRST, each arranged through the app's own path and put
 * back in `finally`:
 *   - `advanced.workflowEngine` on: the yaml adapter mounts the Run panel only
 *     then (lib/formats/adapters/yaml.tsx) and Rust refuses `run_workflow`
 *     otherwise (workflow/guards.rs). Set through the `vmark-settings` storage
 *     event (hooks/useSettingsSync.ts), which the engine-policy sync
 *     (services/workflow/workflowEnginePolicySync.ts) forwards to Rust.
 *   - `general.coherenceCaptureOnSave` off: with it on a save-file step stamps
 *     a `vmark:` identity block into what it writes, and the byte-for-byte
 *     oracle would be wrong on correct output. Pinned only if it is on.
 *   - `formats.defaultViewMode` not `source`: that mode unmounts the preview
 *     pane the panel lives in. Pinned to `split` only if it is `source`.
 *   - a workspace: Run is disabled without one (useWorkflowRunControls.ts
 *     `needsWorkspace`) and the runner sandboxes every path to its root. The
 *     fixture directory is opened through the real approval flow
 *     (e2e/lib/workspace.mjs), with the rail forced OFF so the tab bar is one
 *     context for the whole journey, and closed again afterwards.
 *
 * SKIPS when a workspace is already open: this journey must make its own
 * fixture the workspace root, and closing the user's would be destructive.
 * That is user state, not lost coverage, so it is not `coverageRequired`.
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUE: a save-file run is refused unless its targets are snapshotted
 * first (workflow/prepare.rs), so one snapshot record for this run stays under
 * the dev profile's app data (retention: 50, workflow/snapshots.rs) — there is
 * no command that deletes one. Opening a workspace also shows the sidebar's
 * file view (services/workspaces/openWorkspaceByPath.ts); it is put back to
 * hidden, or to the outline, through the same menu commands a user has — any
 * other prior sidebar view is logged, not restored. The recent-workspace entry
 * is removed through the DEV seam journey 37 uses.
 *
 * WAITS — all `poll()`: the panel mounting (a lazy chunk), Run becoming
 * enabled (the workspace root and the parsed graph), the run having started
 * (Cancel shown, or a step already painted — a three-step local run can finish
 * between two polls), every step painted `success` with Run offered again, and
 * the file on disk. Run is re-clicked only while NOTHING has started: the
 * engine flag reaches Rust asynchronously, and a start refused as
 * `feature-disabled` registers no run, so retrying it cannot double-run.
