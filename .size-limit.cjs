/**
 * Bundle size budget for VMark.
 *
 * Each entry pins the maximum byte size of a built chunk. Limits sit 5%
 * above current sizes — rounded up to 0.1 kB under 10 kB, 0.5 kB under
 * 100 kB, 1 kB above — so day-to-day bumps pass while accidental regressions
 * (e.g. a vendor chunk that was lazy becoming eagerly imported) trip CI. A
 * limit far above its chunk lets a regression of that size through
 * unnoticed, so a chunk that shrinks takes its limit down with it.
 *
 * Two tiers:
 *   - "EAGER:"  preloaded on first paint via `<link rel="modulepreload">` or
 *               static imports from the entry chunk. Growth here directly
 *               slows app launch and increases install download size.
 *   - "LAZY:"   only loaded after a route or feature trigger (Settings,
 *               Source mode, export, workflow panel). Growth here is OK as
 *               long as the chunk stays out of the eager preload list.
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm size            check all chunks against limits
 *   pnpm size:why        explain what's inside a chunk (slow)
 *
 * If a limit fails:
 *   1. Run `pnpm size:why` (or open dist/ in source-map-explorer) to find
 *      what landed in the chunk.
 *   2. If the bump is intentional, raise the limit AND note in the comment
 *      what feature added the bytes — drift without a story is the bug.
 *   3. If accidental, fix the import (usually a static import that should
 *      be `await import(...)`).
 *
 * NOTE: filenames in dist/assets/ include content hashes (e.g.
 * `vendor-mermaid-2D5fMZtm.js`). The globs strip the hash. The entry chunk
 * is named `entry-<hash>.js` via rollupOptions.output.entryFileNames so it
 * can be budgeted without a rot-prone hash-pinned glob (audit 20260612 H9 —
 * the previous `index-BUAvxpLj*` glob silently stopped matching and the
 * entry chunk went unbudgeted).
 *
 * ONE positive glob per budget (negations are fine). size-limit fails when a
 * budget's globs match no file at all, which is what makes a renamed chunk
 * loud — but with two positive globs, one can go dead while the other keeps
 * the budget passing. scripts/check-size-budgets.test.mjs enforces the rule
 * and pins size-limit's no-match failure against the installed CLI.
 *

    // that code into App and the vendor chunks, and nobody lowered the number,
    // so this budget has been ~90x above reality and could not have failed on
    // anything. WI-13 itself ADDS ~4 kB here (10.4 → 14.3): the format
    // adapters' import thunks compile to dynamic-import glue that lives in the
    // entry chunk. That is the trade — 4 kB of glue in exchange for 0.66 MB
    // off the cold-start closure — and it is the reason the headroom is 40%
    // rather than the file's usual 5%: more lazy boundaries mean more glue.

    // useUpdateSync, debounce, …) now lives IN it. Nothing new loads: the
    // whole cold-start closure went 3.05 → 3.09 MiB (+1.3%, dependency
