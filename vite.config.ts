 * start only after `initSecureStorage` — two IPC round trips — had resolved.
 * A modulepreload fetches and compiles a module WITHOUT evaluating it, so the
 * download overlaps those IPCs while App's stores still hydrate after the

      //      itself" seconds after an unrelated test run started.

      //      repo, so saving AGENTS.md from inside the app reloaded the app —

    // `baseline-widely-available` resolves to a set pinned to a date fixed per
    // Vite MAJOR, so upgrading Vite silently raises the oldest macOS that can
    // run VMark. Left unset, it did exactly that — the app claimed macOS 10.15
    // while emitting Safari-16.4 syntax, and a macOS 12 user got a window that
    // rendered nothing, because the bundle failed to PARSE before any of our
    // code, error handling or logging could run (issue #1278).
    //
    // This is NOT a no-op pin of the previous behaviour. The default was the
    // five-entry list `[chrome111, edge111, firefox114, safari16.4, ios16.4]`,
    // and esbuild downlevels to satisfy ALL of them — so the app was carrying
    // transforms for three engines it never runs in. Measured: 35,724 KB →
    // 35,716 KB of `dist`. Small, because Safari is nearly always the binding
    // constraint, which is also why nobody noticed the other four were there.
    //
    // The browser-facing artifact is unaffected: `src/export/reader/` reaches
    // exported HTML through a `?raw` import, so Vite ships it verbatim and no
    // target applies to it. Its compatibility is a property of how it is
    // written, not of this line.
